agentic systems and workflow automation.

### Projects

**[VectorLite0.3: actual block-bucket retrieval](https://github.com/midya8/vectorlite)**

VectorLite now has actual reusable block buckets. An optional backend partitions fixed binary signatures into r+1 disjoint blocks, unions exact-key postings and verifies full Hamming distance before unchanged cosine/id rescoring. The original signature scan remains the default and reference.

59 Python tests retain all50 prior tests;8 Node/actual-Chrome tests retain all3 prior tests. Independent native and BigInt small-cube oracles each cover5,376 query/radius/mode comparisons. Another480 random excluded-query checks,360 random cosine rankings and105 original-spec backend rankings agree with scans. All34 full reports,1,908 selected Chrome rows,24 responsive views and2 trusted JSON exports are checked. An installed8-module wheel reproduces all35 old audits,34 new reports and both new CLI entrypoints.

A constructed512-row24-bit/radius2 control needs3 lookups,11 posting visits and9 full Hamming checks versus512 scan checks. A dense duplicate control would visit1,536 postings; auto instead scans after3 lookups. These are structural counts, not elapsed time, measured RAM or total operations. The fallback rule is a heuristic, not a general sublinear guarantee. Exact signature filtering is still approximate cosine retrieval, not semantic relevance. The r+1 exact-block method is a credited specialization of established multi-index hashing, not a new algorithm.

**[EmbedKit0.3: exact finite retry sampler audit](https://github.com/midya8/embedkit)**

EmbedKit now audits the noise behind its negatives. The unchanged sampler excludes positive context and earlier negatives, retries20 times, then returns the first eligible sorted word. Native Fraction and independent browser BigInt count exact53-bit proposal intervals and propagate every reachable bounded subset state, with finite retry versus unlimited conditional rejection on the same proposals.

61 Python tests retain all53 prior tests and40 original trainer tests. Eight Node/actual-Chrome tests retain all4 prior tests;33 complete reports agree on2,085 exact rational strings and3,682 numeric values, with maximum normalized decimal-display delta2.22e-16. Independent enumeration checks10,844 small-grid random tuples and289 unlimited-conditional ordered paths. Scripted calls exercise1,659 actual original-sampler grid boundaries plus success/retry/fallback consumption. All195 witness states,20 responsive views and2 trusted downloads are checked. A fresh10-module installed package reproduces original training/19 old step reports and all33 sampler reports through both new entrypoints.

Source feature/PR/main checks and Pages deployment were verified before this showcase update. Exact probabilities assume independent uniform-grid proposals, not a true-IID claim about deterministic PRNG output or an exact fixed-seed joint law. Multi-draw audits are bounded to8 words; the unchanged32-word synthetic corpus is one draw only. Final subset TV is not ordered-sequence TV, and inclusion weights do not imply expected changing-vector SGD updates. Expected fallback events are not probability of any fallback. Undefined unlimited rejection at zero eligible mass stays undefined. No training-quality, speed, generalization or new-algorithm claim.

**[QuantLab0.3: activation integer dot products](https://github.com/midya8/quantlab)**

QuantLab now traces activation × weight integer dot products, not only packed weights. A fixed user-declared activation range produces signed 8-bit codes; every integer product and partial accumulator stays visible. Exact rational witnesses separate weight error from activation error. The constructed default has zero weight error, yet activation rounding changes a strict row-1 winner into a zero-code tie won by row 0.

47 Python tests retain all 39 earlier tests. Independent floor/remainder rounding checks 240 seeded reports and all 519 signed half-unit controls. Python Fraction and independent browser BigInt dyadics agree on 72 complete reports with 6,848 products and all exact error strings. Actual NumPy2.2.6 int32 matmul and cumsum check every accumulator and prefix. Seven Node/actual-Chrome tests cover 168 row selections, 20 responsive views, two trusted downloads replayed natively and stale-result rejection. A fresh isolated eight-module package reproduces original training, all 52 old reports and all 72 new reports, with both new CLI entrypoints. Original QLB1 bytes and 59/60 weight-only synthetic results remain unchanged.

Source PR3 passed all 16 latest feature/PR jobs and merged with previous history intact. All 53 merged files and ten deployed assets match the tested public source. Merged-main eight-job CI and Pages passed. The complete deployed browser workflow passes; all 20 unmasked local/deployed captures are pixel-identical. Desktop and phone controls, values and tables were inspected. Integer products and prefixes are exact under the checked shape bound of 2,064,512. Final output rescaling uses binary64, not integer-only end-to-end inference. Fixed activation range is supplied, not calibrated. Exact fractions describe represented-real maps, not runtime summation or unseen accuracy. Error decomposition is order-dependent arithmetic, not causal attribution. No hardware speed, RAM, learned improvement, new algorithm or ONNX/TFLite compatibility claim. Established quantization literature is credited.

**[GraphLab: joint deletion audit](https://github.com/midya8/graphlab)**

GraphLab now enumerates every original-edge deletion set up to a declared budget, recomputes all degree normalization and exposes all target logits, class changes and signed nonadditivity residuals. A four-node control keeps class 1 under every single deletion, yet a pair flips to class 0 while summing those single effects still predicts class 1. Inspect the complete census, including a stronger minimum-margin pair, instead of a hidden top-k attack list.

51 Python tests retain all 42 original tests. Independent dense/bitmask checks cover 180 seeded graph/model cases; 70-digit Decimal checks all 16 counterexample sets. Python/JavaScript agree on 46 complete reports and 559 subsets. Actual NumPy checks all 559 logit vectors, max difference 8.88e-16. Five Node/Chrome tests cover 24 responsive views, 568 subset selections and six natively replayed trusted downloads. An isolated wheel checks seven module origins and all nine commands via both entrypoints. Original trained GCN/MLP/scrambled results, centroid/final controls and both figures reproduce unchanged.

Source PR1 passed all 16 latest feature/PR jobs and merged with prior history intact. All 44 merged files and five deployed assets match the tested source. Merged-main CI and Pages passed after enabling the repository's Pages source. Full deployed Chrome workflow passes. Twenty of 24 unmasked captures are byte-identical in pixels; the other four differ only on one 150-pixel table-border line, with identical layout/content. The four differences were inspected, not masked. Actual desktop and phone graphs, values and complete tables were inspected. This is a bounded binary64 fixed-model sensitivity census, not a causal effect, learned robustness improvement, new algorithm, formal real-arithmetic certificate or scale claim. Original edges only, with self loops retained. Chosen two-class margins stay separate from all-class predictions. Established GCN and formal graph-verification literature are credited.

**[RectLab0.2](https://github.com/midya8/rectlab)**

RectLab0.2 makes every optimal factor set accessible by exact lexicographic index, not only the first. Inspect each factor's complete inclusion count and mandatory/optional/never status in unrestricted covers, maximal-only covers and disjoint partitions. In the default, R12 appears in 40/68 unrestricted optima versus 9/13 maximal-only optima; R0 appears in 1/68 and is ineligible under maximal-only restriction. A unique-cover control instead has three mandatory factors.

18 Python tests independently enumerate every optimum of all three families on all 512 binary 3×3 matrices and nine developed controls. Python/BigInt agree on 64 complete reports; all 170 small-control primitive forgeries fail per engine. The independent checker uses forced-factor inclusion-exclusion/residual partition recursion, not producer optimal-prefix/suffix propagation. Actual Chrome checks all 130 developed optimal sets at four widths: 520 set views, 2,988 membership rows, trusted rank controls and 18 independently checked downloads. An isolated six-module wheel adds 54 select/rank pairs. The 159 actual SciPy MILP objectives remain supplemental numerical evidence, not membership/count/rank proof.

Source PR2 passed all 10 latest feature/PR jobs and merged with previous history intact. All 30 merged files and five deployed assets match the tested source. Merged-main CI and Pages passed; deployed native Chrome passes, and all 40 unmasked local/live captures are pixel-identical. Schema 2 adds the complete census and rejects old schema 1 certificates until regenerated from input. Certificates retain canonical index 0 regardless of the inspected view; indices reproduce selections without exporting a different report. Counts concern distinct unordered optimal factor sets, not learned likelihoods. Established counting/ranking theory is credited; no random sampler, new mathematics or scale claim.

**[SubgameLab](https://github.com/midya8/subgamelab)**

Exact finite sequential multiagent analysis separates a root-stable outcome from a credible contingent plan. The default has two pure Nash plans but only one subgame-perfect plan. A same-player control needs a joint two-node change to improve, while a chance-zero branch still carries a subgame obligation. Inspect every full-player alternative, continuation payoff, reach probability and backward-induction tie.

14 Python tests include 2,916 exhaustive two-decision games. Python/BigInt agree on 65 complete reports, 1,233 profiles and 48,250 alternatives; both engines reject 317 primitive forgeries. A separate leaf-path checker reconstructs every report. Actual Nashpy 0.0.43 checks 533 input-built subtree matrices with a documented numerical-tolerance caveat. Outside-checkout wheel reproduction and 40 deployed Chrome views with 20 trusted downloads pass.

Source PR1 passed all 12 feature/PR jobs and merged with history intact. Pages deployment passed; all 27 merged source files and five deployed assets match the tested source. All 48 unmasked deployed captures match local pixels. Merged-main CI passed. Deployed desktop/mobile pixels were inspected. Classical theory and existing game-theory software are credited; no mixed-equilibrium, formal-proof, new-algorithm or real-agent-strength claim.

**[CompileLab](https://github.com/midya8/compilelab)**



Exact finite Boolean knowledge compilation makes every reduced ordered decision graph inspectable. Two paired equalities keep the same four full models while their ordinary ROBDD uses 6 to 9 nonterminals across all 24 orders. Projection is a different operation: an OR control has three full models but two retained assignments, with unequal hidden-extension fibers. Inspect every graph path, reduction decision, skipped-variable weight factor and complete extension witness.

15 native tests include 2,048 exhaustive clause/keep settings, 180 seeded inputs and separate truth-function replay. Python/JavaScript agree on 102 complete reports; 719 primitive forgeries fail per engine. Actual dd 0.6.0 checks 574 input-built CNFs, complete original/projected model sets and exact weighted masses. Clean installed-wheel reproduction passes. Actual Chrome checks 48 responsive views, 144 graphs, 924 assignment paths, all 120 boundary-control orders and 12 independently replayed downloads.

Feature/PR, merged-main and Pages checks passed. All 30 public files and six deployed assets match tested source. The complete deployed Chrome workflow passes; all 64 unmasked captures match local pixels. Actual desktop hero, phone zero-mass verdicts and narrow boundary graph were inspected. Classical ROBDD theory and existing certified projected-compilation work are credited. No new algorithm, formal-proof or scalable-compiler claim.

**[FireLab](https://github.com/midya8/firelab)**



A balanced firing multiset can still have no legal first step. This exact finite Petri-net inspector separates token balance, supplied-count execution and arbitrary goal reachability. The catalyst control reaches its goal only by borrowing a token, acting and returning it. Inspect every marking, guard, shortest tie and partial-multiset prefix/suffix.



18 native tests include 4,704 exhaustive cases and independent full-report replay. Actual PM4Py 2.7.23 checks 164 input-built nets. Python/JavaScript parity, isolated installed reproduction and 56 deployed Chrome views with 14 independently replayed downloads pass. Feature/PR, main and Pages are green; all 32 source files and five live assets match. Established theory and original bounded controls, not a new algorithm or a real-agent guarantee.

**[ParetoLab](https://github.com/midya8/paretolab)**

Exact finite biobjective DAG planning retains all paths and nondominated tradeoffs. The developed choices `(0,12)`, `(7,7)`, `(12,0)` leave the middle path Pareto but unsupported: it requires both`t >= 7/12`and`t <= 5/12`. A hard second-cost ceiling7 selects it. A separately labeled whole-path lottery yields expected `(5,7)` with7/12 probability of exceeding that realized ceiling. No expected-feasibility safety claim.

20 Python tests include729 exhaustive ordered three-path profiles.52 full native/browser reports,579 rejected primitive forgeries per engine,556 input-built HiGHS graph-MILP/probability-LP solves and clean installed reproduction pass. Actual Chrome checks48 responsive views,220 path selections and24 native downloads independently replayed by Python. Exact weight cells, endpoint dominated ties, epsilon thresholds and Pareto-label pruning remain inspectable. Classical attributed theory, developed synthetic controls, no learned preference, scale or new-algorithm claim.

Feature/PR, merged-main and Pages checks passed. All31 public files and five deployed assets match checked source. Deployed Chrome passes;39/40 unmasked captures are pixel-identical, with only18 border-antialias pixels differing by at most2/255 in the remaining hero. Actual desktop/phone layouts inspected.

**[AuctionLab](https://github.com/midya8/auctionlab)**

Exact finite multiagent allocation makes VCG prices, report-independent bundle menus and seller-coalition deficits inspectable. A developed classical-pattern control has welfare 12, revenue 8 and deficit 2:individual truthfulness does not imply cooperative-core stability. Every efficient tie and supplied unilateral-report optimum is retained.

24 Python tests,52 cross-language reports,1,204 tamper rejections per engine,1,024 independent HiGHS integer solves and clean-wheel reproduction pass. A bounded 196-profile type exhaustion checks 5,488 reports and 12,348 outcomes. Actual Chrome checks 48 responsive views and 32 native input/certificate downloads. Python replay is independently implemented; browser census replay shares evidence construction. Developed synthetic controls, not held out; no actual auction, payment, collusion audit or new-mechanism claim.

Feature/PR, merged-main and Pages checks passed. All 47 public files and five deployed assets match checked source; all 30 deployed captures match inspected local pixels.

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/auctionlab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/auctionlab) · [Case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/auctionlab.md)

**[MatchLab](https://github.com/midya8/matchlab)**

Exact finite two-sided matching keeps the full stable family, both proposer traces and every strict blocking-pair test. An original profile costs 3 without stability and 13 at its unique stable cost minimum, which is neither proposer-optimal extreme. Another original control gives an incomparable diamond lattice. Inspect every attainable stable partner, lattice operation/cover and cost/blocker-cap frontier. Supplied costs are separate from ordinal preferences.

20 Python tests, 76 full cross-engine reports, 1,372 primitive forgery rejections, 152 independent input-built HiGHS integer solves and clean installed CLI reproduction pass. Actual deployed Chrome checks 48 responsive views, 1,149 selected assignments, 453 proposal states, 243 lattice selections, 450 cap selections and 16 natively replayed downloads. Feature/PR, main and Pages checks passed; all 44 public files, five deployed assets and 31 captures match checked source/local pixels. Classical attributed theory, original bounded teaching profiles, no fairness, strategic-honesty-for-both-sides, real-allocation or held-out benchmark claim.

**[OrderLab](https://github.com/midya8/orderlab)**

Exact finite weighted Kemeny aggregation with all tied optimum orders and independent ballot-inversion replay. A strict adjacent-local endpoint costs 10, the unique global optimum costs 8, and the independent-pair lower bound is 7. Inspect every majority cycle, complete-order ballot/pair/swap ledger and subset-DP transition. All 720 optima survive the six-candidate all-tie control.

18 Python tests, 76 complete Python/JS reports, 1,100 rejected primitive mutations, 65 independent HiGHS integer solves and clean installed CLI reproduction pass. Actual deployed Chrome checks 48 responsive reports, 5,091 selected orders, 846 subsets and sixteen native-replayed downloads. Feature/PR, main and Pages checks passed; all 46 public files, five deployed assets and 35 captures match checked source/local pixels. Classical attributed theory, original bounded profiles, no learned relevance, fairness, election recommendation or held-out benchmark.

**[CredalLab](https://github.com/midya8/credallab)**

Exact finite probability compatibility and one-shot decisions with independently replayed primal/dual evidence. Version 0.2 separates pairwise defenses from one shared best belief: the menu `(3,0),(0,3),(1,1)` leaves the third action maximal and pure maximin, yet a fixed half/half rival mixture excludes it everywhere by exactly `1/2`. Inspect E-admissible, strict maximal, interval-undominated, pure maximin/maximax sets, common-belief witnesses and randomized exclusion proofs. No pointwise prefilter; boundary ties stay.

31 Python and six combined Node/Chrome tests pass. Decision evidence adds 96 complete Python/BigInt reports, 824 primitive forgeries, 1,420 independent input-built HiGHS LPs and both isolated installed CLI entry points. Original 120-report/505-forgery/690-LP probability checks remain. Actual Chrome checks every developed action and certificate row, including 855 decision certificate selections and native-replayed downloads. Feature/PR, merged-main and Pages checks passed; all ten deployed assets and 79 combined captures match checked source/local pixels. Bounded original teaching controls, classical attributed theory, no learned preferences, practical recommendation or held-out benchmark.

**[ChannelLab](https://github.com/midya8/channellab)**

Exact finite binary experiment comparison with a constructive state-independent garbling or a strict two-action decision witness. Version 0.2 adds an exact prior atlas over [0,1] for one fixed payoff table: every affine deterministic policy, closed optimality range, endpoint and interval ties, ranking crossings, no-signal value and information-value line. Separate Python verification and lossless BigInt agree on 710 complete atlases / 8,486 policies / 3,401 knots / 2,691 intervals. Independent optional HiGHS diagnostics execute 16,972 policy-range LPs with zero tested endpoint discrepancy; the original 1,420 information-order LP checks remain.

Version 0.2.0: 30 Python tests, six Node/actual-Chrome tests and isolated installed-wheel reproduction pass. All five deployed assets match merged source; all 53 complete and atlas-focused deployed captures match inspected local pixels. Feature, PR, merged-main and Pages checks are green. These are developed finite controls, not held-out evaluation, learned sensor quality, privacy, finance or real-world safety evidence.

**[RiskLab](https://github.com/midya8/risklab)**

Exact finite scenario-tree decisions under static and nested CVaR. Inspect every full deterministic policy, terminal probability, split boundary atom, threshold/envelope certificate and continuation regret. A disclosed development control chooses static policy p3 at 7/3 versus nested p2 at 22/9; a separate control shows that a root-optimal nested policy can still have a worse reached continuation. Separate path/vertex verification, a lossless BigInt inspector and 9,896 executed HiGHS LP comparisons accompany 821 complete cross-engine reports / 1,121 policies, 16 Python tests, four Node tests and isolated wheel reproduction.

Supplied teaching trees with at most 15 nodes, eight leaves and four decisions. Classical risk-sensitive planning, not a learned agent, held-out benchmark, financial advice, new CVaR algorithm or real-world safety guarantee. Exact arithmetic does not validate the supplied model.

**[CutLab](https://github.com/midya8/cutlab)**

Exact binary submodular energy graph cuts with signed rational offsets, every pair/terminal reduction, shortest augmenting paths including reverse routing, every-cut residual dual slack and the full SCC/closure optimum family. A strict single-flip control stops at energy 2 while the certified joint optimum is 0; a unary-only control has gap 2. Independent Python/BigInt agree on 24 reports / 24,624 exact leaves. 21 Python tests on 3.10-3.13, complete rendered records, SVG checks and installed reproduction. Supplied synthetic costs, at most six variables; classical methods, no learned model, image benchmark, speed or new-algorithm claim.

**[FactorLab](https://github.com/midya8/factorlab)**

Exact rational finite factor elimination with every joined product, reduction/tie, fill edge and small-order census. A mixed sum/max control returns an upper bound of 11 versus true marginal-MAP mass 10, while joint MAP weight 6 projects to the wrong decision. A five-variable star gives the same partition at 62 versus 18 joined entries, width 4 versus 1. Independent Python/BigInt agree on 24 reports / 23,114 exact leaves; 24 Python tests on 3.10-3.13, dense partial-product oracles, full-record Chrome checks and installed reproduction. Supplied synthetic potentials, not learned quality, a scalable solver or a timing benchmark. [Live elimination inspector](https://midya8.github.io/factorlab/) · [Method and limits](https://github.com/midya8/factorlab/blob/main/METHOD.md).

**[SubmodLab](https://github.com/midya8/submodlab)**

Exact rational finite subset selection with every greedy marginal, optimum tie, monotonicity edge, local diminishing-return witness and proof-derived cardinality upper bound. The retained coverage counterexample gives greedy 5 versus optimum 6; a separate singleton top-k control gives 5 versus updated greedy 9. Invalid synergy/nonmonotone tables withhold theorem fields. Dependency-free Python and independent BigInt JavaScript agree on 24 complete reports / 16,426 exact leaves, with 24 Python tests on 3.10-3.13 and actual-Chrome checks of 360 subset rows/bars and 2,056 full records. Established theory on at most six items, not learned similarity, a scalable optimizer or downstream selection quality. [Live selection inspector](https://midya8.github.io/submodlab/) · [Method and limits](https://github.com/midya8/submodlab/blob/main/METHOD.md).

The separate rounding inspector now exposes the exact multilinear extension, every excluded-item gradient and excluded-pair Hessian context, independent-product count probabilities and both endpoints of every deterministic cardinality swap. A two-item half-probability control has expected count 1 yet exceeds budget 1 with probability 1/4; its duplicate-coverage expectation 3/4 rounds to a singleton worth 1. Nonmonotone submodular controls are accepted, while synergy and wrong total probability mass refuse rounding. The extension adds nine Python tests (33 total), 21 reports matching 10,682 exact native/BigInt leaves, independent product/derivative/path oracles, full-record Chrome checks and installed reproduction. This is bounded deterministic rounding, not continuous optimization, randomized marginal preservation, a general matroid method or a learned-quality claim.

**[DPPLab](https://github.com/midya8/dpplab)**

Exact-rational finite DPP subset laws with every determinant, inclusion-kernel witness, Schur include/exclude conditioning and fixed-total-size contrast. Dependency-free Python and independent BigInt JavaScript agree on 24 complete reports / 4,050 exact leaves; 24 Python tests on 3.10-3.13 and actual-Chrome full-record/geometry checks. Duplicate-item controls separate zero co-occurrence from equal-marginal independence. Established bounded L-ensembles, not learned relevance, a scalable sampler or a downstream quality result.

**[CTCLab](https://github.com/midya8/ctclab)**

Offline CTC target marginalization with log-space forward/backward, full state/symbol posteriors and logit gradients, plus every exhaustive path and collapsed transcript. The editable independent JavaScript inspector shows why a greedy best path can lose to summed transcript mass: two uniform blank/A frames assign 0.25 to empty output and 0.75 to A. Twenty retained reports, 25 Python tests across 3.10-3.13, Decimal/state enumeration, 300 finite-difference checks and real-Chrome full-record/diagram audits. Established CTC on tiny synthetic logits, not a trained recognizer, speech/OCR benchmark or novel algorithm; numerical rank buckets and impossible-target conventions are explicit.

**[PPOlab](https://github.com/midya8/ppolab)**

From-scratch NumPy PPO with a corrected internal-timeout collector, separate bootstrap/trace masks, full GAE credit matrices and sign-dependent clip-gradient audits. Independent scalar JavaScript evaluates all 4,675 checkpoint parameters and real CartPole physics. Fifty Python tests retain all 18 original tests; four Node/actual-Chrome tests compare 26 full reports/12,408 numbers and all 14,871 original one-step observations. New free-running paths can diverge: the reference run differs on 377 actions despite matching all 30 return lengths. Original checkpoint/results retained; no training-improvement, speed, trajectory-equivalence, KL-bound or universal-solve claim.

**[TagLab](https://github.com/midya8/taglab)**

Manual linear-chain conditional random fields with analytic gradients and all 327 optimization states replayed. The selected chain improves test NLL (0.557614 versus 0.813715) but loses on Viterbi token errors (66/164 versus the trained same-feature control's 56/164). Exact fixed-score inference covers position-wise label events, auditable joint-path sampling and nonlocal occurrence-count events. Count-augmented prefix/suffix messages expose complete count laws, conditional nodes/pairs, best paths and event derivatives. An independent-node count control shows why matching expected counts does not enforce an exact total. 43 Python and 20 Node/Chrome tests cover rational/BigInt path oracles, finite differences, cross-language witnesses and 5,895 UI states/queries; eleven-module/nine-command installed reproduction. Original synthetic sequences, not an NLP benchmark, causal experiment or calibrated confidence. Original fits and budget-exhaustion warnings stay visible; deterministic PRNG, finite-precision and near-tie limits are explicit.

**[SpectralLab](https://github.com/midya8/spectrallab)**

Normalized spectral clustering with manual affinity/Laplacian/k-means code and explicitly disclosed NumPy eigensolves. All 18 fixed graphs and raw k-means controls remain visible; larger eigengaps and spectral rounding can still give worse answers. v0.2 adds full degree-response derivatives and a basis-invariant projector tangent, four smooth base graphs, 28 fixed finite states including a boundary refusal, and two refused base controls. Shared-scale heatmaps compare actual refits with first-order geometry; numerically equal tested rounding partitions remain explicit, not a label-gradient or robustness claim. Thirty-three Python and nine Node/real-Chrome tests cover independent graph/cut references, 83 derivative controls, repeated-block rotations, 1,728 original browser point states and 168 new sensitivity states. Installed six-module/nine-command reproduction checks four exact exports. Original synthetic full-data illustrations, not held-out prediction or exact discrete optimization. [Graph inspector](https://midya8.github.io/spectrallab/). [Sensitivity inspector](https://midya8.github.io/spectrallab/sensitivity.html). [Derivation and limits](https://github.com/midya8/spectrallab/blob/main/SENSITIVITY.md).

**[ForestLab](https://github.com/midya8/forestlab)**

Manual binary CART forests with exact integer Gini split ordering, complete bootstrap-count witnesses and an editable inspector that separates full-forest votes from OOB votes. Exact-copy grouping prevents identical licensed UCI feature vectors from crossing partitions. All eight forests, four single trees and seven controls stay visible: the validation-selected forest makes 3/270 test errors, versus a stronger selected 5NN control at 0/270 and a single tree at 8/270. 39 Python and 12 Node/real-Chrome tests cover 60 rational split oracles, 10,784 forest comparisons, 8,088 control scores, 6,464 OOB membership records and 992 actual browser paths. Ten-module/ten-command installed reproduction. Historical numeric classification, not banknote authentication; vote fractions are not calibrated probabilities and OOB is not independent specimen validation. [Live forest and OOB inspector](https://midya8.github.io/forestlab/). [Method and limits](https://github.com/midya8/forestlab/blob/main/METHOD.md). V0.2 adds [joint permutation diagnostics](https://midya8.github.io/forestlab/permutation.html): all 15 feature blocks, 16 shared shuffles and 129,600 model-row prediction checks, including the stronger frozen 5NN control. Donor/recipient witnesses and an exact support counterexample stay visible. Reused-validation description, not causal importance, fresh test performance or uncertainty intervals.

The v0.3 [leaf-collision inspector](https://midya8.github.io/forestlab/proximity.html) exposes all-tree similarity as an explicit Gram matrix, with exact integer/BigInt sum-of-squares witnesses. A separate jointly-OOB view keeps pair-specific tree counts and undefined comparisons. A constructed negative quadratic form (-2) and triangle failure show why OOB normalization is not a universal kernel guarantee. All 512 small partition controls, 5,760 native/scalar-JS matrix entries, 1,152 actual pair states and 13,824 heatmap colors are checked. Frozen supervised model geometry, not semantic similarity, causal influence, uncertainty or a new score. [Geometry derivation and limits](https://github.com/midya8/forestlab/blob/main/PROXIMITY.md).

**[RatingLab](https://github.com/midya8/ratinglab)**

Observed-only rating factorization with manual NumPy alternating ridge solves, per-block decrease accounting, normal-equation residuals and full gradients. All eleven fits remain inspectable. A separately validation-selected bias-only control slightly beats the selected factors on test RMSE (.656176 versus .656457); all eight factor fits exhaust their stationarity budget. 37 Python and 14 Node/real-Chrome tests include 60 independent exact rational ridge references, eleven fresh refits, test-label poisoning and 12,771 scalar/native predictions. The browser recomputes arbitrary indexed pairs and shared factor rotations, exposing why coordinate products are not causal preferences. Ten-module installed wheel with eight main CLI commands and two single-row conditional-response module commands. CC BY 4.0 historical UCI ratings, MIT code. Missing pairs are not negatives, and observed-rating RMSE is not top-N relevance, missing-pair accuracy or calibrated certainty. [Live rating inspector](https://midya8.github.io/ratinglab/). [Equations and limits](https://github.com/midya8/ratinglab/blob/main/METHOD.md).

The v0.2 conditional-response extension separates saved scores, a freshly re-solved unmodified ridge block and its finite rating edit or row deletion. It exposes leverage, the positive deletion denominator, query derivatives and all-opposite-index response curves. Sixty additional exact rational design systems, 2,784 direct deleted-block refits and 576 native/scalar-JavaScript witnesses check the formulas. Original factors and scores are unchanged. The mean and opposite factors remain frozen and retain information from the row: this is not full-model leave-one-out validation, causal influence, data unlearning or an uncertainty bound. [Conditional edit/deletion inspector](https://midya8.github.io/ratinglab/influence.html). [Derivation and limits](https://github.com/midya8/ratinglab/blob/main/INFLUENCE.md).

The v0.3 joint-batch inspector changes or removes multiple original training rows within one frozen block. Target edits add; joint deletions solve a coupled Schur system and generally differ from a sum of separate-original-baseline deletions. It shows the full source-bound problem, conservative positive-ridge bound, numerical condition/refusal checks and all-query joint/separate curves. Independent checks add 320 rational direct-system cases, 128 real augmented-least-squares cases and 320 complete native/browser Cholesky responses plus 4 controls. 37 Python and 14 Node/actual-Chrome tests, ten-module wheel and eight main CLI plus two single-row module commands. Original fits, scores and stronger bias control stay unchanged. This remains a conditional calculation, not full ALS retraining, cross-validation, causal attribution, uncertainty or data unlearning. [Joint batch inspector](https://midya8.github.io/ratinglab/batch.html). [Derivation and limits](https://github.com/midya8/ratinglab/blob/main/BATCH.md).

**[MarginLab](https://github.com/midya8/marginlab)**

Manual linear/RBF soft-margin SVM learning with replayable pair updates and editable30-feature scores. Version0.3 adds exact finite original-unit input boxes: attained affine score bounds, both corners, tie-aware labels, all30interval edits and independent Fraction/BigInt readers with separate source consistency.36Python/15Node-real-Chrome tests include120exhaustive corner cases,256direct exact dual endpoint sums,128full cross-language responses,4,552original inference checks and eight fresh fits. Installed reproduction covers11modules and9maincommands plus the box exporter. Original fits, holdout scores, split and exact training-objective proofs are unchanged. Synthetic boxes are not clinical tolerances or plausible interventions; exact affine arithmetic is not a floating-inference safety, RBF, generalization or authenticity guarantee. [Exact input-box inspector](https://midya8.github.io/marginlab/box.html). [Derivation and limits](https://github.com/midya8/marginlab/blob/main/BOX.md).

**[MixtureLab](https://github.com/midya8/mixturelab)**

Manual Gaussian-mixture EM on licensed UCI chemistry: constrained covariance M-steps, complete likelihood/Q/KL witnesses and a frozen label-free holdout across all 24 fits. Scalar-browser density, input derivatives, full Hessians and bounded sufficient-ascent traces expose the difference between local calculations and mode certificates. Original models, data, splits and scores stay unchanged. Component posteriors are not cultivar probabilities or calibrated certainty. CC BY 4.0 data, MIT code. [Density inspector](https://midya8.github.io/mixturelab/). [Input geometry](https://midya8.github.io/mixturelab/geometry.html).

The new [observed-coordinate conditional inspector](https://midya8.github.io/mixturelab/conditional.html) reweights by marginal evidence and keeps full Schur-complement, within- and between-component covariance. Synthetic controls show a mean in a density gap and variance increasing from 1.09 to 25.1. 45 Python/eleven Node tests cover 100 independent precision-block controls, 5,696 original model/row/mask factorization checks, 160 complete native/scalar-JS references and 160 actual UI cases. Twelve-module/nine-command installed reproduction retains all original refits and audits. Analytical masks on complete source data, not real missingness validation, causal inference, calibrated intervals or new accuracy. [Conditional method and limits](https://github.com/midya8/mixturelab/blob/main/CONDITIONAL.md).

**[PartsLab](https://github.com/midya8/partslab)**

Nonnegative parts learning on the original UCI digits: six manual NumPy factorization fits, fixed-basis NNLS with per-row numerical KKT stopping, and actual editable-input browser decompositions. All 3,823 training images fit without labels; training-only restart selection preserves the 1,797-row official holdout. Rank-matched signed PCA and SVD beat NMF on test MSE at every fixed rank and stay visible. All six joint fits exhaust their stationarity budget, rather than being mislabeled converged. Zero-locking, scale/permutation and duplicate-basis controls expose why additive parts are not unique semantic explanations. 38 Python and eleven Node/real-Chrome tests include independent active-set oracles, finite-difference gradients, full test-loader-prohibited refits, 120 native/browser decompositions and 2,048 contribution pixels. Ten-module/ten-CLI installed wheel; CC BY 4.0 data, MIT code. [Equations, protocol and limits](https://github.com/midya8/partslab/blob/main/METHOD.md). [Open the live parts inspector](https://midya8.github.io/partslab/).

The v0.2 fixed-basis certificate adds exact binary64 primal/dual arithmetic, outward-rounded objective intervals and portable JSON proofs with an independent Python Fraction verifier. Eighty exact rational active-set optima and all 120 cross-language witness references are checked. The live browser verifies its own candidates, including zero-sweep unfinished solves, and accepts valid pasted proofs while rejecting tampered ones. A residual-shift bound can be loose; even zero gap does not imply unique coefficients. Original fits, scores and selection remain unchanged. [Certificate proof and limits](https://github.com/midya8/partslab/blob/main/CERTIFICATE.md).

V0.3 adds an [exact fixed-face pixel inspector](https://midya8.github.io/partslab/face.html): nominate a face from the numeric NNLS result, re-solve it exactly, and intersect every affine KKT inequality with the pixel domain. All endpoint ties, singular refusals, singleton faces and duplicate-basis nonuniqueness stay explicit. 38 Python and eleven Node/Chrome tests cover 200 independently enumerated tiny face candidates, all 120 stored nominations, 54 complete native/BigInt/Worker witnesses and 10,368 endpoint pixel colors. Ten modules/ten commands with all six fresh fits reproduced. Original data, models and scores remain unchanged. One candidate interval, not a full path, unique support, robustness or joint-NMF optimum. [Math and limits](https://github.com/midya8/partslab/blob/main/FACE.md).

**[ClusterLab](https://github.com/midya8/clusterlab)**

Real-data unsupervised clustering with manual k-means++/Lloyd updates, forty complete restart witnesses and fitting-only PCA/whitening controls. All 3,823 original UCI training digits fit without labels; the 1,797-row official holdout is audited with permutation-invariant scores and all-row silhouettes. The live browser recomputes membership for editable digits, displays mixed-label centroids and exposes all restart descents. Raw uniform initialization slightly beats careful seeding on test ARI despite slightly worse fitting inertia; no general seeding advantage or cross-geometry inertia ranking is claimed. 48 Python tests plus thirteen Node/real-Chrome tests cover independent pair/entropy/distance references, a rational local-minimum counterexample, full refit with test-loader prohibition, frozen-hash evaluation, all 80 public model/example cases and keyboard/copy/download/mobile controls. Ten-module/six-CLI installed wheel. [Open the live clustering inspector](https://midya8.github.io/clusterlab/). CC BY 4.0 data, MIT code; arbitrary groups, not digit predictions or calibrated confidence.

The v0.2 restart inspector exposes all forty saved models, 180 distinct within-arm restart comparisons and forty self-pairs. A manual integer Hungarian solver supplies optimal center permutations and primal/dual witnesses, independently checked against subset-DP optima for all 220 matrices. Browser BigInt checks those exact saved rounded-cost certificates; 800 native/scalar-JavaScript inference pairs and all 400 directed pair controls are tested. Same-data initialization sensitivity is not sampling stability or useful-class discovery; matching centers need not align the actual assignment for an input. Original fits and holdout scores remain unchanged. [Open the live restart inspector](https://midya8.github.io/clusterlab/stability.html). [Restart matching method](https://github.com/midya8/clusterlab/blob/main/STABILITY.md).

The v0.3 ambiguity audit adds 2,200 exact selected-edge exclusion witnesses, best-distinct permutations and optimal-matching counts. Independent full-cost dynamic programs check all 220 gaps and counts; browser BigInt verifies all 4,000 oriented exclusions. The matching is unique in every saved real matrix, while tied and unused-tight-edge controls expose why an optimum alone proves neither uniqueness nor a large margin. A strict sufficient cost-entry perturbation bound is not a sharp radius, pixel robustness or statistical uncertainty. All original fits, scores and earlier matching witnesses remain unchanged. [Uniqueness and gap proof](https://github.com/midya8/clusterlab/blob/main/AMBIGUITY.md).

**[DenoiseLab](https://github.com/midya8/denoiselab)**

DenoiseLab's [two-pixel retrieval map](https://midya8.github.io/denoiselab/plane.html) now shows exact rational closed minimum cells over two observed values, including area, segment-only, point-only and explicitly proved empty regions. Fraction/BigInt witnesses retain all 3,062 original fitting-row coefficients. A source-matched verifier checks supporting halfplanes, maximal lower-dimensional cells and nonnegative infeasibility combinations without rerunning clipping. Shared boundaries use complete all-row exact tie queries, not an interior representative. [Geometry, proof and limits](https://github.com/midya8/denoiselab/blob/main/PLANE.md).

52 Python/fourteen Node/Chrome tests include independent boundary-pair enumeration of 238 small-source cells and 2,110 rational queries, forty complete cross-language maps, 160 browser queries and 30,720 actual canvas colors. Ten-module/nine-command installed reproduction retains full refit/evaluation. [Scalar paths](https://midya8.github.io/denoiselab/path.html), [neural/PCA response](https://midya8.github.io/denoiselab/response.html) and the [original reconstruction audit](https://midya8.github.io/denoiselab/) remain live with stronger winning controls visible. Fixed two-coordinate slice only, not general robustness, causal recourse, uncertainty, better accuracy or binary64 tie equivalence. Licensed UCI data, MIT code; original models and scores unchanged.

**[TreeLab](https://github.com/midya8/treelab)**

Budgeted whole-ensemble counterfactual search with exact weighted-L1 objective bounds, verified common-input witnesses and explicit optimal/infeasible/unfinished states. A best-first queue intersects all 32 trees, propagates forced branches and uses known one-axis witnesses as checked warm starts. The fixed 36-case audit preserves unfinished all-feature searches at 4,096 expansions instead of calling them optimal or infeasible; alcohol-only cases can finish. 101 Python tests plus five Node/real-Chrome tests include independent tiny-forest exhaustive grids, budget-gap checks, member inference and responsive inspector controls. Nine-module/nineteen-CLI wheel reproduction; original models, reports and three figures unchanged. Established constrained model search, not causal recourse, plausible chemistry, scalable optimization or new accuracy. The [ensemble search inspector](https://midya8.github.io/treelab/forest.html), [single-tree explorer](https://midya8.github.io/treelab/counterfactual.html) and [one-axis explorer](https://midya8.github.io/treelab/) remain live.

**[DigitLab](https://github.com/midya8/digitlab)**

A [live model inspector](https://midya8.github.io/digitlab/) now adds baseline-relative class-logit Integrated Gradients for the unchanged UCI digit models. Choose the class and zero or fit-only mean reference, inspect all 64 signed contributions and their logit-sum residual, and keep the attack label separate. An algebraic tanh specialization is checked against independent 128-node quadrature on 40 reference vectors; all 7,188 official model/reference/row cases are finite. 78 Python tests and six Node/real-Chrome tests include 106 attribution reference vectors plus the existing 52 inference/gradient cases. Four reproducible audit figures, ten-module/ten-CLI wheel checks, and mobile/keyboard/touch controls. Established attribution, not a new method, causal importance, explanation quality or a certificate. The stronger same-fit 1NN clean result, exact linear box/radius proofs and original data/models remain visible.

**[ScanLab](https://github.com/midya8/scanlab)**

Exact state-space scans with failure controls, not a speed benchmark.
v0.3 adds coupled full-matrix transitions, noncommuting order witnesses,
transposed reverse adjoints and every matrix/write/initial-state JVP/VJP.
The transpose identity is -440563/15120; a missing-transpose control gives gap
7831/2520. Reversing only matrix-product order changes the final state, while
both mistakes are invisible on diagonal restrictions. Six two-state steps use
108 multiplications/80 additions versus sequential 24/24, despite unit-pair
span 4 versus 6. 63 tests include 96 homogeneous-product shapes, 672 independent
polynomial VJP coordinates, 51 instrumented arithmetic cases and all preserved
diagonal/HVP/gated controls. Three full-witness SVGs, six-command/nine-module
wheel parity and five CI jobs. Serial Python, not a general AD engine,
dense HVP, trained Mamba/S4, new algorithm or GPU-throughput claim.

**[Correlab](https://github.com/midya8/correlab)**

Exact-rational general-sum joint-play obedience, finite-history and private override-signal certificates. Coarse, pairwise, full-swap and conditional gains retain every term and attaining deviation. v0.2 adds explicit hidden-baseline pass/override channels, supplied post-garbling lifts with exact slack identities, and all action partitions through size four. Developed controls give gains 4/3, 5/3, 1 for three two-signal partitions; attributed Roth reveal controls bridge 0 to 11/30. Two reproducible SVGs, seven-module/seven-CLI wheel parity and 50 tests. Supplied finite models only, not an equilibrium solver, learned information design, universal channel-order test, privacy or safety guarantee.

**[GameLab](https://github.com/midya8/gamelab)**

Exact-rational zero-sum game audits with complete optimal faces, minimax witnesses and deterministic perturbation certificates. The interval extension computes fixed-policy worst joint gap using one shared payoff table: its developed control gives gap 1, not the incompatible separate worst-regret sum 2. Signed support witnesses, attainable value extrema and separate robust-security policies stay visible. Strict offline JSON CLI, two reproducible SVGs, six-module wheel parity and 53 tests. Small supplied boxes, not statistical coverage, coupled uncertainty, worst-gap policy optimization, real-agent strength or a scalable/new solver.

**[BetLab](https://github.com/midya8/betlab)**

Exact-rational sequential evidence for bounded paired model scores, with fixed/past-only betting, full null-tree audits and prespecified start allocations with future reserve. The confidence extension inverts a separate conservative fixed-bet mean family, certifies rational crossing/noncrossing brackets and retains earlier bounds after reversal. Its 256-path coverage control excludes the true mean with probability 2187/16384 at alpha 1/4. Three reproducible SVGs, strict offline JSON CLI, seven-module wheel parity and 67 tests. Supplied-law/fixture audits, not drifting-mean estimation, optimized betting, causal effects or model-selection correction.

**[PrivacyLab](https://github.com/midya8/privacylab)**

Exact finite-channel differential privacy with rational hockey-stick events, adaptive transcript laws and clipped-mass certificates. The factor-frontier extension computes every affine piece of the worst-neighbor profile, including a developed switch at 5/4 absent from the likelihood-ratio grid. Exact inverse delta budgets retain minimality witnesses or singular-support obstructions, and distinguish huge finite factors from impossible targets. Three reproducible SVGs, strict offline JSON CLI, seven-module wheel parity and 63 tests. Small supplied-law certificates, not trained-model privacy, secure sampling or a production accountant.

**[SparseLab](https://github.com/midya8/sparselab)**

LASSO optimization audits with primal/dual/KKT witnesses, duplicate-coefficient ambiguity and exact Gap Safe zero certificates. The affine-branch extension solves rational Gram equations and every sign/inactive KKT half-line: its developed control has five exact intervals, a feature leaving at lambda = 1 and re-entering negative at 1/3. Boundary zeros are allowed; singular branches return explicit noncertificates. Strict offline JSON CLI, three reproducible SVGs, seven-module wheel parity and 62 tests. A supplied-branch verifier, not a general LARS solver, complete support recovery, causal feature selector or speedup claim.

**[InfluenceLab](https://github.com/midya8/influencelab)**

Convex logistic influence functions with converged Newton fits and full Hessian/solve witnesses. The deletion-path extension refits continuously along selected weight changes, then checks integrated local derivatives against actual endpoint loss. Deleting all seven developed rows reverses the frozen first-order sign (-0.004253 vs +0.079105); group deletion is not a sum of separate refits. Simpson16 residuals stay visible, including +0.000744 on that all-row path. Strict JSON CLI, two reproducible SVGs, five-module wheel parity and 43 tests. Small numerical reference, not causal attribution, certified quadrature or machine unlearning.

**[FisherLab](https://github.com/midya8/fisherlab)**

Exact-rational natural-policy-gradient geometry, with singular Fisher solves, full RREF/nullspace witnesses and positive pairwise PSD certificates. Four full-tangent charts agree exactly; diagonal/identity-damped approximations and nonlinear finite steps expose the limits. The shared-context extension has positive aggregate reward derivative 1/64 but context 1 derivative -1/8, with exact projection 7/16=1/64+27/64. Independent context parameters reach both targets; uniform reweighting changes the objective, and naive joint logits can move supposedly fixed context mass. Strict offline JSON CLI, two reproducible SVGs and 45 tests. Local supplied-model audits, not an MDP trainer or optimizer-superiority benchmark.

**[LatentLab](https://github.com/midya8/latentlab)**

A Gaussian VAE from scalar Python, with all 150 pathwise gradients checked independently. The importance extension separates random log-evidence estimates, expected IWAE bounds and same-sample Jensen comparisons. An exact linear-Gaussian posterior recovers its known evidence; a full-support rare-atom control has ESS 64 yet underestimates evidence by factor 999,000 on an event with probability 93.80%. Neural noise prefixes are visibly nonmonotone. The original trained fixture still shows lower no-KL reconstruction error but worse prior samples; even beta 1 leaves 51.56% outside the mode neighborhoods. 43 tests cover independent derivatives/quadrature, exact rational rare-event expectations, extreme log weights, strict checkpoints and two reproducible SVGs. Five-module wheel reproduces both demos outside checkout. Evidence auditing, not IWAE training, an ESS accuracy certificate, exact nonlinear likelihood, image generation or distribution recovery.

**[ErgodLab](https://github.com/midya8/ergodlab)**

Exact rational stationary policy sensitivity, Poisson bias and Markov reward audits. Independent directed spanning-tree derivatives match normalized stationary linear systems. The discounted extension separates the true fixed-start objective gradient from a stationary proxy: at beta 1/2 the proxy has exact curl -1/147, ruling out a local scalar potential, and differs from the true gradient [5/98,-1/98]. At beta 1 it uses the centered Poisson limit, not a singular inverse. Original fixtures retain the occupancy-only gradient 1/18 and sticky/alternating reward variances 7/4 versus 0 despite identical one-step variance 1/4. 39 tests cover independent paths, determinants, finite differences, analytic proxy/curl grids and two reproducible SVGs. Six-module wheel verified outside checkout. Supplied finite irreducible models, not GPOMDP, training, gradient-estimator variance, a CLT or a monotone-bias guarantee.

**[ScoreLab](https://github.com/midya8/scorelab)**

Exact policy-gradient distributions, complete trajectory witnesses and rational covariance certificates. Matrix-valued time/state score controls solve singular normal equations and minimize the full covariance within a fixed linear-control class. A three-action example has exact gradient [-1/9,1/3]: the best scalar baseline leaves trace variance 53/612, while a full matrix gives zero on every action. A separate 64-path sequential model has only a small change, 1.462519 to 1.460918, with singular score ranks [1,0,1,1,1,1]. Original scalar audits retain the value-baseline counterexample, increasing variance 4/625 to 36/625. 36 tests include 256 analytic Bernoulli policies, independent derivatives and Cartesian covariance references, matrix-control checks across 15 additional settings, all principal minors of gap certificates, nonunique coefficients with unique supported corrections, coordinate-transform congruence and two reproducible SVGs. Six-module wheel verified outside the checkout. Exact supplied finite models, not training results, a fitted critic or universal zero variance.

**[BanditLab](https://github.com/midya8/banditlab)**

Exact finite-budget Beta-Bernoulli planning with complete posterior-state graphs, action values/ties, a fully updating greedy control and exact clairvoyant prior bound. A prescribed three-pull example chooses the lower-mean arm first: optimal expected reward 187/108 versus greedy 46/27, gain 1/36. At two pulls both first arms tie and gain is zero. New forward audits support named or exact randomized state policies, conserve probability at every pull and expose all reward/occupancy flows. Summed occupancy-weighted optimal Bellman gaps equal policy loss: greedy loses 1/36 at its first decision; fixed loses 7/108 across three decisions. Optimal/greedy visit 14 of 35 possible states, fixed visits 10. 34 tests include 2,048 two-arm and 1,728 three-arm policy-tree references, 144 independent named-policy history audits, randomized joint-history checks, independent Bernstein/Beta integrals and two reproducible SVGs. Six-module wheel verified outside the source tree. Exact supplied-prior expectations, not empirical trials, causal attribution or frequentist guarantees.

**[BeliefLab](https://github.com/midya8/belieflab)**

Exact rational finite-horizon POMDP planning for two hidden states, with policy-tree witnesses and all-belief envelopes. An optimized open-loop baseline checks every fixed action sequence over the same model and horizon: the supplied sensing fixture gives contingent value 7/10 versus zero at the uniform belief, with exact feedback-gap area 49/400. A forward execution audit traces every history/state mass, conditional belief and discounted reward contribution, including impossible branches without fabricated posteriors. Fixed-tree regret certificates expose every zero-regret interval: a probe tree optimal at the uniform prior loses 13/10 at either certain-state prior. Discounted all-belief Bellman-residual brackets connect finite envelopes to infinite optimal value without pretending the finite tree runs forever: raw residual 1/100 can hide value error 1. A perfect-probe fixture brackets infinite value 9/10 by [113/150,9/10]. 86 tests cover exact residual cells, independent infinite-value references and 81 model settings, complete depth-two trees, fixed sequences, exact crossing cells, full joint path occupancies and independent belief recursion. Strict JSON CLI, preflight caps, four reproducible SVGs and an isolated ten-module wheel. Supplied-model calculations only, not learned information value, empirical calibration, causal sensor performance or real-world safety.

**[BellmanLab](https://github.com/midya8/bellmanlab)**

Exact rational discounted planning with residual certificates, rectangular robust control and nested controller/adversary policy iteration. A residual of 1/100 hides value error 1; a nominal winner loses 6/5 under supplied ambiguity; global uncertainty (-2/3) differs from row-wise closure (-2). Exact inner nature solves expose every policy, scenario Q-value and tie. Controller improvement waits for inner stability: independent cap examples distinguish an upper bound, an exact nonoptimal policy value and a jointly stable optimum. 70 tests audit independent 972 nominal and 3,888 controller/adversary policy references, every nested witness, monotonicity, both cap paths and three SVGs. Strict rational JSON, full histories and an isolated eight-module wheel. Supplied models only, not learned confidence, online RL, unique-policy, policy-loss or real-world safety guarantees.

**[VariLab](https://github.com/midya8/varilab)**

Mean-field inference and exact graph inference from scratch, with inspectable certificates rather than optimizer success claims. A supplied two-mode Ising target improves ELBO from 1.386294 to 3.005027 while maximum mean error worsens from 0 to 0.994902. Exact-rational Hessian congruence and signed witnesses distinguish saddles, singular boundaries and adjacent binary-float inputs without a tolerance. Evidence-aware forest sum-product and rational MAP add full message traces, exact tie counts and compatible joint decisions. Bounded cyclic elimination adds symbolic resource preflight, conditional query tables and rational MAP traceback: a 63-spin odd ring has exact score 61 and 126 optima; independent locally optimal spins can still form a wrong joint answer. A refused star order is contrasted with an accepted order on the same graph. 183 tests and six reproducible SVGs cover independent exhaustive oracles, full intermediate factors, score/count certificates and both passing and failing gates. Dependency-free Python, strict JSON CLI and an isolated-wheel demo. Supplied models only; float sum-product is separate from binary-rational scores. No learned posterior, calibrated uncertainty, causal, optimal-treewidth or runtime claim.

**[RobustLab](https://github.com/midya8/robustlab)**

Binary linear adversarial robustness from scratch: exact L1/L2/L-infinity norm-ball margins and attainable perturbation witnesses, with hand-derived robust logistic subgradients. A fixed shifted synthetic holdout exposes the clean/robust trade-off: ordinary training is 100% clean / 20% strict robust at L-infinity radius 0.30; robust training is 80% / 80%. Both robust-gate directions stay visible. Independent rational corner enumeration, finite differences and nonsmooth subgradient inequalities. Exact rational L1/L-infinity audits expose float boundary-flag disagreements while preserving the actual binary input values. Box-constrained L1/L-infinity audits return equal exact primal/dual bounds and expose a false robustness claim from clipping an L1 attack. 80 tests and three reproducible SVGs. Dependency-free Python and strict JSON CLI. Supplied linear models and explicit norm balls or box intersections only; mathematical audits, not neural-network or production security guarantees.

**[CausalLab](https://github.com/midya8/causallab)**

Exact finite structural causal models with distinct observation, intervention and shared-noise counterfactual queries. A 100-world confounding fixture reverses a +.26 association into a -.10 supplied-model intervention difference; observationally identical mechanisms still disagree on intervention and counterfactual answers. Log-space rare evidence, bounded noise-world traces and all 64 tiny Boolean mechanism pairs. Named multi-world counterfactual joints expose shared-noise response dependence missed by identical action marginals. Stable/flip mechanisms share all observations and single-action marginals but have different response-type joints. The naive-product failure stays visible. Sharp binary response bounds now return exact rational attaining joint witnesses from point action marginals, with optional explicit monotonicity and undefined zero-support conditional rates. Graphical d-separation adds ancestor/moral-edge certificates, collider-descendant checks and explicit incoming-edge surgery. A bounded backdoor-set search exposes collider bias, forbidden descendants and explicit candidate availability. 138 tests and five reproducible SVGs keep the missing coupling assumptions visible. Dependency-free Python and strict JSON CLI. Mechanisms are supplied assumptions, not causes learned from observational data.

**[ParticleLab](https://github.com/midya8/particlelab)**

Bootstrap particle filtering from scratch with complete log-weight, resampling and ancestry histories. A static-support failure ends with full weight ESS but zero particle variance while the exact posterior remains uncertain. Kalman/static-square references, terminal-weighted genealogies and bounded backward-simulation smoothing with a linear RTS reference, a no-resampling comparison, all sixteen development seeds and 114 tests keep the approximation inspectable. Early path collapse stays visible even when current states are distinct; backward draws add path diversity without claiming exact uncertainty. An optional linear observation-conditioned proposal includes all-seed predictive-weight comparisons, including worse variance RMSE on the inherited example. Dependency-free Python, strict JSON CLI and reproducible SVG. Finite scalar models, not convergence or calibrated real-data claims.

**[SegmentLab](https://github.com/midya8/segmentlab)**

Exact offline Gaussian changepoint inference that exposes confident outlier cuts, impossible joint events and the gap between MAP and minimum expected boundary loss. Normalized constrained priors, full partition marginals, direct joint draws, same-design replicate mixtures and entropy/KL audits remain inspectable. 104 tests, exhaustive tiny references, dependency-free Python, strict JSON CLI and two reproducible SVGs. Supplied model assumptions, not online event detection or real-data calibration.

**[HamiltonLab](https://github.com/midya8/hamiltonlab)**

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo from scratch with full rejection histories, leapfrog energy/reversibility and quadratic resonance audits. High acceptance can hide zero mode switches or almost-identity trajectories; optional state-independent random lengths retain every choice and work count. Rank-normalized split/folded R-hat exposes deterministic scale and half-chain failures missed by classical ratios; undefined components remain null. 82 tests, dependency-free Python, offline sample/demo/quadratic/diagnose/harmonic/window/window-mixture CLI and SVG. No speed ranking, adaptive NUTS, ESS/MCSE or convergence certificate. Synthetic chains and analytic truths, not fitted posterior results. Analytic Gaussian flow separates mass/phase effects from integration error, with exact sign-flip and identity counterexamples. Fixed and IID random-duration q/q² covariance audits and a reproducible shared-axis SVG expose frozen magnitude even with zero position correlation; no sampled-chain ESS/MCSE claim.

**[TransportLab](https://github.com/midya8/transportlab)**

Log-domain entropic optimal transport with full mass plans, explicit nonconvergence and weighted interpolation atoms. Full pushforward preserves actual endpoint marginals; barycentric means do not. Separate rounded primal/dual audits retain raw failed solves and report signed numerical gaps, marginal residuals and L1 changes. Analytic fixed-iteration plan tangents expose a nonconverged envelope-shortcut error0.007670872, checked against central differences. Zero support, covariance decomposition and exact tiny assignment remain visible. 46 tests, offline solve/assignment/push/audit/sensitivity CLI and SVGs. Not a metric, sampled trajectory, implicit-optimum gradient or certified OT bound.

**[FlowLab](https://github.com/midya8/flowlab)**

Affine-coupling flow from scratch: exact fitted-model density, inverse sampling, analytic input scores and bounded conditional CDF/quantile slices. Aligned window audits reuse one scored grid and expose renormalization effects: narrowing[-4,4] to[-1,1] removes24.35%-31.94% of interpolated mass inside the finite outer window. An analytic narrow-peak counterexample shows two agreeing grids can both be wrong. 45 tests, strict artifacts, offline CLI/SVGs and actual call budgets. No whole-line tail, exact-conditional, calibrated-coverage, OOD or causal claim.

**[DiffuseLab](https://github.com/midya8/diffuselab)**

Learned 2-D diffusion from scratch, now with selected-grid DDIM sampling and exact denoiser-call audits. The same 482-parameter model uses 8/16/64 DDIM steps without retraining. Eight steps saves 87.5% of predictor calls but has worse symmetric reference distance here (0.210661 vs DDPM 0.037103), despite a slightly higher near-center fraction. All 8 neighborhoods reached, uneven frequencies and outliers retained. Full-grid eta=1 matches DDPM arithmetic with matched draws. 33 tests, strict artifacts and offline train/sample/DDIM CLI. Development fixture only, no walltime speedup, image-generation or general ranking claim.

**[ChainLab](https://github.com/midya8/chainlab)**

Hidden Markov models from scratch: log-space inference, Viterbi paths and multi-sequence Baum-Welch, now with prefix-only filtering and multi-step symbol/state forecasts. An exact example separates x-only filtering P(A)=2/3 from future-informed x/y smoothing P(A)=0. Forecasts are dependent horizon marginals, not a joint path. Prefix predictive log scores match full likelihood to about 5.68e-14 on the seed23 development fixture; that is an implementation audit, not a new quality gain. Existing test NLL per symbol: trained0.775631, iid control0.985993, initialization1.017638, generating reference0.771674. Exhaustive references, impossible-prefix rejection, 41 Python tests, four Node/actual-Chrome tests and offline CLI/SVG demo. No calibration or state-recovery claim.

Live v0.2 [prefix-evidence inspector](https://midya8.github.io/chainlab/) keeps all three original models and both exact counterexamples fixed. Edit a bounded observation window and compare each own-prefix filtered row, full-window smoothed row, supported Viterbi path and prefix-only future marginals. Original 40-symbol reports and scores remain unchanged; the first three displays show only the first 12 symbols. Independent scaled browser versus native log inference checks cover 114 symbol edits and 40 prefix boundaries, plus 62 exhaustive high-precision controls. Underflowed browser mass refuses instead of inventing a posterior. 41 Python tests, four Node/actual-Chrome tests and installed eight-module/nine-command reproduction. No new training, state accuracy, calibration or causal claim. [Conditioning and numerical limits](https://github.com/midya8/chainlab/blob/main/EVIDENCE.md).

**[KernelLab](https://github.com/midya8/kernellab)**

Gaussian-process regression and finite-grid expected-improvement suggestions from scratch. Cholesky solves, separate latent/observation covariance, explicit jitter, marginal likelihood and fixed-parameter LOO. Deterministic EI excludes known rows and returns a full candidate audit, without executing evaluations. A nine-evaluation toy optimization comparison reports grid regret 0.000163 (EI), 0.072944 (space filling) and 0.399473 (one seeded random control). Same pool/initialization/budget; development data, no general ranking or continuous optimum claim. The regression misspecification counterexample remains visible. Dependency-free Python, 43 Python tests, four Node/Chrome tests, offline CLI and reproducible SVGs.

Live v0.2 [target-response inspector](https://midya8.github.io/kernellab/) keeps both original GP models fixed. Edit one observed target and inspect all 15 signed response weights: the conditional mean moves, while latent/observation variances stay unchanged. Independent browser LDL versus native Cholesky checks cover 202 query witnesses and 3,030 direct edited-target predictions, plus high-precision tiny controls and shared-axis endpoint checks. Original misspecification results and optimization traces are unchanged. Signed weights are not causal attribution or calibrated confidence; refitting invalidates the fixed-kernel contrast. 43 Python tests, four Node/actual-Chrome tests and installed eight-module/seven-command reproduction. [Derivation and numerical limits](https://github.com/midya8/kernellab/blob/main/RESPONSE.md).

**[BoostLab](https://github.com/midya8/boostlab)**

Binary gradient boosting from scratch: mean-residual defaults plus optional capped, L2-regularized Newton leaves on residual-SSE trees. The development fixture selects 35 Newton trees/237 nodes, test accuracy 0.9004/logloss 0.3341; its unselected 80-round checkpoint is also shown (0.8984/0.3469). Mean depth-2 control: 0.8906/0.3400; full-budget stumps: 0.6367/0.7366. Different capacity and settings, no causal or external-benchmark claim. Backward-compatible v1/v2 inference, Hessian/leaf arithmetic tests, validation-only prefix selection. Dependency-free Python, 36 Python tests and five Node/Chrome tests and offline CI.

Live v0.2 inspector retains all 80 fitted trees and 81 prefixes for each original arm, including the selected zero-tree stump. Editable inputs expose complete additive-logit/tree-route witnesses, original selected-versus-last checkpoints and shared zero-based loss curves. No new tuning, attribution, calibration or performance claim. All original development-fixture metrics and limits above are unchanged. Independent native/browser checks cover 4,860 original and 1,458 edited prefix states, 78 complete paths and all 243 metric states. 36 Python tests, five Node/actual-Chrome tests, installed seven-module/five-command reproduction. [Try the training path](https://midya8.github.io/boostlab/) · [Derivation and numerical limits](https://github.com/midya8/boostlab/blob/main/PATH.md).


**[ShapleyLab](https://github.com/midya8/shapleylab)**

Exact small-feature Shapley attribution from scratch: all empirical-background coalitions auditable, callback API and JSON CLI. Same product prediction 6 gives [3, 3, 0] or [2, 3, 0] with different backgrounds. An off-manifold hybrid counterexample passes additivity, showing why exact arithmetic is not explanation validity. Joint missing-feature dependence preserved; preflight exponential-work budget; independent factorial reference checks. No conditional/causal or trained-model quality claim. Optional atomic groups move correlated blocks together. Three-way product gives grouped [1/2, 1/2], not post-hoc [2/3, 1/3]; grouped games answer a different question. Up to 64 raw features/12 groups, no within-group credit split or cross-group dependence guarantee. Optional seeded permutation mode handles up to 64 individual features with cached coalitions and descriptive MC standard errors. A two-permutation product gives [0.5, 0.5, 0] despite exact [1/3, 1/3, 1/3], showing zero observed MC error is not an accuracy bound. No confidence guarantee or sampled groups. Dependency-free Python, 43 tests and offline CI. v0.2 adds an independent [live coalition ledger](https://midya8.github.io/shapleylab/): actual native callback rows, all weighted predecessor terms and cached full ordering paths. 49 Python + four Node/actual-Chrome tests, 95 edits, 128 Fraction and 64 BigInt controls; installed reproduction retains all original modes. Original data, scores and adverse examples unchanged. No stronger explanation-quality claim.

**[PolicyLens](https://github.com/midya8/policylens)**

Offline contextual-bandit evaluation from scratch: IPS, SNIPS, direct and doubly robust estimates with support/weight diagnostics. On a constructed balanced design, IPS/SNIPS/DR recover target 0.78 despite a wrong reward model; clipping raises ESS but moves DR to 0.535. A separate noisy log with oracle reward predictions gives DR 0.7532, not exact truth. No causal-identification, confidence-bound or deployment-safety claim; explicit propensity, support and nuisance-prediction assumptions. Optional held-out categorical reward fitting reports fold/cell counts and prior-only predictions; row-iid splitting does not fix grouped or sequential leakage. On the same noisy log, fitted DR 0.7509088 is not better than oracle DR. Dependency-free Python, 28 tests and offline CI. v0.2 adds an independent [live row ledger](https://midya8.github.io/policylens/): all signed contributions and cap removals, five support/zero-mass/rare-action controls, bounded target/reward edits and fixed-prediction deletion reports. 36 Python + four Node/actual-Chrome tests, 95 edits, 160 Fraction and 80 integer-grid controls; original four reports unchanged. ESS, cap curves and deletion reports are descriptive, not confidence bounds or cap recommendations.

**[DriftLens](https://github.com/midya8/driftlens)**

Embedding-distribution comparison from scratch: unbiased RBF MMD, cached-kernel permutations, exact tiny-sample tests and complement-sum scoring for imbalanced groups and a JSON CLI/API with Holm-corrected prespecified bandwidth families and optional within-block permutations, plus descriptive row-index witness diagnostics (not causal attribution). Selected 30x4 development fixture: same-generator p=0.550, mean-shift p=0.002 (the 1/500 resolution floor); a tiny separated 2-vs-2 sample still has exact p=1/3. No power-benchmark, cause, downstream-accuracy or continuous-monitoring claim. Explicit exchangeability and prespecified bandwidth assumptions; non-rejection is not equivalence. Dependency-free Python, 45 tests and offline CI.

**[SetGuard](https://github.com/midya8/setguard)**

Split-conformal classification sets from scratch: JSON fit/predict artifacts, finite-sample rank correction, exact tied-score audits and per-class/size diagnostics, plus optional label-conditional classwise thresholds with explicit rare-class inclusion. On the five-class development fixture, target 0.9 gives empirical coverage 0.9235 at mean set size 3.017 versus argmax accuracy 0.4960; a deliberately adversarial label shift drops coverage to 0.0760. The standard marginal-coverage theorem needs exchangeability and a predictor fixed independently of calibration, not every realized class rate/input or shifted-data guarantees. Classwise mode targets coverage within true labels under its stated exchangeability assumptions, at a set-size cost. Dependency-free Python, 41 Python tests plus four Node/Chrome tests and offline CI.

[Live rank ledger](https://midya8.github.io/setguard/) adds five fixed synthetic controls, every boundary tie and pooled/classwise label inclusion, 19 alpha samples, full JSON and held-position rank checks. Independent native/browser arithmetic matches 95 witnesses; installed wheel reproduces the original reports. Original controls remain attached. No fixed-split, causal, uncertainty or deployment guarantee.


**[CalibrLab](https://github.com/midya8/calibrlab)**

Confidence calibration from scratch in pure Python, with a JSON CLI/API for your own validation/test logits and unclipped logit-space NLL, plus optional conditional paired test-row bootstrap intervals: an overfit small-data MLP (train 1.0000, test 0.5563) is measured badly overconfident on the checked-in fixture (ECE 0.2765; top bin 0.9735 confidence at 0.6602 accuracy), then one temperature fit on validation NLL only cuts ECE to 0.0651 and test NLL from 2.0030 to 1.2060 at exactly zero accuracy change - the invariance asserted bit-for-bit, the oracle-T gap reported (0.0076), and gradients hand-derived and finite-difference verified. (56 Python tests plus four Node/Chrome tests)

[Live score ledger](https://midya8.github.io/calibrlab/) exposes five synthetic controls, every row logit NLL/class Brier term, confidence-bin gap, migration count and fixed-temperature deletion, with19sampled temperatures and full JSON. Independent native/browser arithmetic matches95witnesses; installed wheel rebuilds original training/logits/report. Original evidence unchanged. No calibration-only, causal, uncertainty or deployment claim; full-precision oracle gap rounds to.0075 versus.0076 from rounded NLL subtraction.

**[DistillLab](https://github.com/midya8/distilllab)**

Knowledge distillation from scratch in pure Python: a 10x smaller student gains +0.0656 test accuracy over direct training on the checked-in fixture (0.7469 vs 0.6813; teacher 0.8344), measured against matched control arms - pseudo-labels on the teacher's argmax exceed direct by +0.0281 and soft-label distillation exceeds pseudo by +0.0375, with uniform smoothing adding nothing and a permuted-target arm at chance; these between-arm differences are fixture measurements, not causal attribution. Gradients hand-derived and finite-difference verified, overfit gap measured (0.3187 direct vs 0.0531 distilled). (24 Python tests plus four Node/Chrome tests)

[Live student-gradient inspector](https://midya8.github.io/distilllab/) exposes every parameter update, hard/soft class derivative, CE/entropy/KL term and all 400 original split predictions. Six original trained students and their initialization stay attached, alongside a small finite-step overshoot control. Independent native/browser witnesses and installed training/wheel reproduction preserve the original experiment. One local update does not identify a causal mechanism, calibration or deployment benefit; stable unclipped inspector losses and the original probability floor are distinguished explicitly.

v0.3 adds a separate target/rest KL chain-rule workbench: four teacher tails preserve the supplied-label target/rest mass at the selected temperature, while independent native analytic and browser reverse-mode gradients expose every class derivative and parameter update. It includes the CE/KL teacher-entropy offset, true excluded-class normalization, bounded input and full replay archives. 36 Python tests retain all 24 earlier tests; seven substantive Node/Chrome tests (eight runner entries), 28 witnesses, 112 variants, 2,368 centered finite-difference checks and both installed CLI entrypoints pass. No DKD training, new method, generalization result or causal account of the original gain is claimed. [Target/rest workbench](https://midya8.github.io/distilllab/tail.html) · [Equations and replay contract](https://github.com/midya8/distilllab/blob/main/TAIL.md)

**[MoeLab](https://github.com/midya8/moelab)**

Sparse mixture from scratch with an [interactive exact-route inspector](https://midya8.github.io/moelab/): Python Fraction and independent browser BigInt cells, point ties, one-sided jumps and fixed-branch derivatives. Rounded inference and exact affine geometry stay distinct; three balance statistics are not interchangeable. Original aux/no-aux/initialization, dense baseline and all 340 rows retained: aux MSE 0.0303 vs dense 0.1853, soft 0.6291, no-aux 0.0015, purity 1.0000 on the synthetic fixture. 39 Python + five Node/Chrome tests, 32 full witnesses and installed-wheel reproduction. No causal, generalization, robustness or serving-speed claim.

**[AlignLab](https://github.com/midya8/alignlab)**

[Finite-policy optimum and KL-budget inspector](https://midya8.github.io/alignlab/): independent Python/browser Gibbs audits over all 1,005 recorded states separate optimizer error from synthetic utility. The original noise-control policy is essentially reward-optimal yet loses utility; stale prose is corrected without changing original training, data, tests or gates. Reference-weighted ties, zero support, underflow and unresolved budgets stay explicit. 47 Python + four substantive Node/Chrome tests, 35 full witnesses, high-precision controls and installed-wheel reproduction. Finite synthetic diagnostics, not causal, safety or generalization guarantees.


**[LoRALab](https://github.com/midya8/loralab)**

Width is not predictive rank: exact rational factors and nonzero minors certify matrix/softmax quotient/finite-probe ranks, with independent Fraction/BigInt engines, a separate native verifier and explicit probe-blind counterexamples. All 124 original states retained; nonzero width 4/8 product rank 3 versus quotient rank 2. 39 Python/seven Node tests and installed replay. Exact linear-softmax functions, not rounded-runtime, saved-byte or training claims. [Exact rank inspector](https://midya8.github.io/loralab/rank.html).

Earlier coordinate inspector, preserved:

Same model, different factor-SGD step: independent Python/browser evaluators expose full factor-coordinate gradients, finite-step identities, matrix gauges and scalar compensation without claiming a new optimizer. All 124 original epoch boundaries, 31-scale sweeps and full exports remain visible. Width 2 reaches shifted accuracy 1.0000 with 67.7% of full fine-tuning's parameters, but retains less original accuracy (0.7556 versus 0.9556). 31 Python tests plus four Node/Chrome tests audit 54 full reports and 591,615 numbers; an isolated wheel reproduces the unchanged experiment. Synthetic finite classifier only, no LLM or causal claim. [Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/loralab/).

**[SpecLab](https://github.com/midya8/speclab)**

Speculative decoding from scratch: greedy verification, exact stochastic residual correction and a prefix-conditioned oracle lookahead planner with no-draft action 0. Complete Bellman action/transition/slack certificates and full sequence/count laws keep probability correctness separate from assigned cost. Switching fixture: `23/10` hypothetical units versus best fixed `47/20`; score-work prices choose no speculation. 47 tests include exhaustive tiny-policy enumeration and independent joint-law checks, with all previous stochastic controls preserved. Five-job CI checks seven modes from an installed 12-module wheel. Full-known-table oracle only: planning overhead is unpriced, no real-LLM benchmark, measured latency or new-algorithm claim.

**[StructGate](https://github.com/midya8/structgate)**

Exact finite-horizon conditioning for a supplied first-order source and total DFA. A legal next symbol can still have an unlikely future: the default word 01 has source probability 1/20, viability-mask probability 1/2 and global conditional probability 1/10. Inspect every future mass, transition, selected-word prefix and forward marginal. The original JSON/schema inspector and all source-model paths stay unchanged.

64 Python tests retain all 54 previous tests; six Node/actual-Chrome tests retain all three previous tests. Independent complete-word checks cover 60 seeded small DFAs and all source/local/global marginals. Native Fraction backward recursion and independent BigInt full forward-kernel propagation agree on 24 complete reports, 2,043 future rows, 6,550 symbol rows and 2,239 marginal rows. Chrome checks all 156 selected-word prefixes, 24 responsive views and two natively replayed trusted downloads. An isolated eleven-module install reproduces all new reports through API, module and console, while the original nine-module wheel/demo/evaluation/gates remain intact. Supplied finite first-order source, not the original order-3 model or an LLM; standard conditioning, not a new decoding algorithm. [Open DFA inspector](https://midya8.github.io/structgate/automaton.html).

**[RAGLine: a zero can win](https://github.com/midya8/ragline)**

An opt-in fixed-corpus signed-vector postings backend runs the actual retrieval loop. An unvisited, implicit zero can outrank a negative match; shared-bin products can cancel to zero. Complete raw-score stable ranking stays intact before slicing and six-decimal score display. The original scan remains the default, with unchanged extraction, citations and lexical grounding.

49 Python tests retain all 31 originals byte-for-byte. Independent dense references cover 729 exhaustive signed-cube controls, 400 seeded real-vector matrices and 1,350 actual hashed-pipeline query/k comparisons. Four Node/actual-Chrome tests check 24 complete integer-engine reports plus 200 seeded native/browser reports, all 186 rows, 1,161 products and 186 signed SVG marks, stale/invalid state, 320/390/1280 containment and two trusted exports replayed natively. A separate installed wheel checks nine module origins, API/module/console reports, 45 real-pipeline fixture comparisons and both CLI gate sides.

The browser is a bounded integer-vector ENGINE reference, not text/IDF pipeline parity. Native text-pipeline comparisons use the original scan within each supported Python runtime. A constructed 32×64 control visits one posting versus 2,048 dense dot-coordinate products, but query still makes all row scores and fully sorts the corpus. These are structural counts, not time, memory or semantic-quality gains. Construction retains a dense snapshot plus postings and cached norms; rebuild after corpus/fit changes. Signed collisions, extractive copying and lexical grounding retain their original limits. No new method or retrieval-quality claim.

**[KVLens](https://github.com/midya8/kvlens)**

Independent full-tensor attention/cache inspector with final-query-only no-cache and optimized-prefill controls, atomic occupied-prefill rejection and independent cache forks. Named default eight-prediction savings: 58.68% against the stronger baseline versus 73.08% for the intact historical pair. Complete Q/K/V, score/value/output/logit contributions, before/after state and full JSON/model exports. 55 Python tests retain all 28 originals; three Node/actual-Chrome tests compare 32 complete reports, 97 predictions and 66,940 numeric entries, with every displayed cell and weight table checked. Counted arithmetic and ideal packed K/V payload, not latency or actual memory.

**[AttnLens](https://github.com/midya8/attnlens)**

A real manually differentiated attention trainer with a fixed-weight intervention workbench. Independent JavaScript recomputes all downstream tensors after head-output ablations, exposes all 16 head subsets on the original 128-example held-out split, and tests matched key/filler changes. Complete trained and same-seed initialization checkpoints, all source weights and full audit exports. Repairs a clipped-loss/nonzero-gradient mismatch with stable log-sum-exp. 59 Python tests retain all 46 originals; three Node/actual-Chrome tests compare 352 full tensor reports and 22 audits, with 704 displayed head-row views. One seed and synthetic task, zero-ablation distribution shift and nonadditivity visible; no attention-as-explanation or discovered-circuit claim.

[Live workbench](https://midya8.github.io/attnlens/) · [Case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/attnlens.md)

Actual [online causal inference](https://midya8.github.io/attnlens/online.html) adds inspectable blockwise running-max/normalizer/value accumulators on the real checkpoints, complete residual-stack logits and independent dense controls. 76 Python/six Node tests; 106 full-model + 80 kernel reports; actual Chrome 2,112 head/query views and two real downloads replayed natively. Original training/interventions intact. Bounded score-buffer count only, not total memory or speed; dense/debug audits remain quadratic. Standard prior algorithm, no GPU/FlashAttention or new-method claim.

**[PlanBench](https://github.com/midya8/planbench)**

Exact finite retry-risk analysis for supplied agent DAGs. Inspect the joint plan-success, completion-time and cost law, including exhausted retries, skip cascades and shared ancestors. A cheap failed run can satisfy a budget by skipping the work: within-limit probability is not successful-completion probability. The original seeded simulator stays unchanged.

39 Python tests retain all 29 originals; four Node/actual-Chrome tests compare 28 complete Fraction/BigInt reports, 260 terminal histories, 177 joint atoms, 778 selected step rows, 24 responsive views and native-replayed trusted exports. An independent Bernoulli-bit/completion-event oracle checks 65 seeded DAGs and retry boundaries. An installed wheel reproduces both new CLI entrypoints and original validate/simulate gates outside the checkout. Supplied independent failures, not production forecasts; no resource contention or correlated outages. [Open risk inspector](https://midya8.github.io/planbench/).

**[DecodeLab](https://github.com/midya8/decodelab)**

Stable staged sampling, complete finite continuation trees and full beam-pruning witnesses. Normalized temperature/top-k/top-p, EOS versus cap mass, and exhaustive same-objective oracles expose both lost better futures and a width 2-worse-than-width 1/3 counterexample. Editable independent scalar-JavaScript inspector with every outcome and JSON export. 54 Python tests (36 original unchanged), 90-digit Decimal/rational references, 32 retained audits, 120 staged cases, 7,927 independent numerical checks, actual Chrome and installed-wheel reproduction. Original n-gram CLI/corpus/demo preserved. Synthetic arithmetic/search audits, not text-quality evidence or a new decoding algorithm.

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/decodelab/)


**[GroundCheck](https://github.com/midya8/groundcheck)**

Complete lexical/citation/numeric provenance with independent scalar-JavaScript recomputation, editable source policies and full input offsets. 66 Python tests retain 43 originals; 50 synthetic controls expose semantic false positives. Four Node/Chrome checks and isolated-wheel reproduction. Lexical support is not entailment; audit parity is bounded ASCII.
[Live provenance inspector](https://midya8.github.io/groundcheck/)

**[TokenForge](https://github.com/midya8/tokenforge)**

Optional occurrence-indexed BPE training with exact original merges and saved artifacts. Live pair sets, linked positions and a lazy heap replace repeated recounting, while the unchanged scan stays the default. An independent browser recounts every overlapping frequency, numeric tie and leftmost replacement on explicit byte rows. Structural work is not a speed, RAM or complexity result.

49 Python tests retain all 40 originals; 4 Node/actual-Chrome tests check 27 full reports, 160 merge selections, 3,033 displayed pair rows, 24 responsive views and trusted exports. Independent Python and JavaScript small-row oracles each cover 2,555 settings, plus 250 native seeded multirow cases. An installed wheel reproduces original and new CLI modes outside the checkout. The original 1,227-byte corpus gives 44 identical merges and saved JSON bytes. Browser checks semantics, not native heap operations; no timing/RAM claim. [Open inspector](https://midya8.github.io/tokenforge/).

**[RetrievalBench: every ranking is a vote](https://github.com/midya8/retrievalbench)**

Exact weighted rank fusion, source prefixes and repeated votes are now inspectable end to end. An opt-in fuse-search command runs the original exhaustive BM25 index on explicitly supplied query variants, then fuses admitted prefixes using standard reciprocal rank fusion. Source scores never enter fusion; all original BM25 search, evaluation and audit commands retain their behavior.

80 Python tests retain all 68 existing tests unchanged. Seven Node/actual-Chrome tests retain all three existing tests. Independent Python Fraction and source-first BigInt arithmetic reproduce 230 complete reports: 2,006 candidate rows, 9,674 candidate/source contribution cells, 6,416 raw entries and 16 actual original-BM25 query-variant pipelines. Native controls include 432 exhaustive permutation/depth/constant comparisons, 200 conservation/order/weight-scaling controls and 100 random actual-BM25 pipeline comparisons. Installed-wheel checks verify nine module origins, every report/pipeline, both new CLI commands and invalid-output preservation.

Every missing versus beyond-depth rank, zero-weight candidate, duplicate ranking, exact fraction and inside/outside cutoff gap stays visible. Final k is separate from source depth. Exact score ties use printable ASCII document-id order, and zero-score candidates remain eligible. Duplicate sources add influence, not independent evidence. The browser replays supplied rankings exactly; it does not claim exact cross-language BM25 logarithms. Standard RRF is credited to Cormack, Clarke and Buettcher, SIGIR 2009. No new method, semantic-relevance improvement, calibrated confidence, speed, causal effect or vendor parity is claimed.

**[EvalForge 0.2: one family, shared cluster signs](https://github.com/midya8/evalforge)**

A separate exact clustered sign-flip audit for common-task model comparisons. Each supplied cluster gets one sign shared across every candidate. The default candidate has raw absolute-sum tail 1/4 but family-maximum tail 1/2. Repeated-row controls show how the declared flip unit changes the orbit without changing observed task-weighted sums. The original regression gate, paired inspector and McNemar calculation stay unchanged.

102 Python tests retain all 92 prior tests; seven Node/actual-Chrome tests retain all three prior tests. Independent original-task relabeling checks 150 seeded matrices and all 729 small two-column controls. Python block aggregation/bit masks and independent browser Cartesian signs/original-task sums agree on 24 complete reports, 118 task rows, 73 cluster rows, 506 full assignments and 10,474 candidate-by-cluster contributions. Chrome checks all displayed rows, bar geometry, stale/invalid state, both exports and 320/390/1280px containment. Isolated installed API, module and console runs reproduce every report, plus all original wheel/adapter/export checks.

Supplied cluster labels do not establish joint symmetry or randomization. Marginal symmetry is insufficient for a joint maximum; no universal strong-FWER, model-superiority or automatic-gate claim. The original paired/adapter/scorer harness stays intact.

**[AgentTrace 0.2: keep the value, respect the overlap](https://github.com/midya8/agenttrace)**

A separate exact fixed-interval retention policy under a supplied overlap cap. With one lane, two touching spans worth 6 each beat one enclosing span worth 9. Native integer min-cost flow exposes every edge, flow, canonical potential and residual reduced cost, with a matching primal/dual bound and exact zero gap. The original trace validator, analyzer, timing inspector and gates stay unchanged.

64 Python tests retain all 57 prior tests; seven Node/actual-Chrome tests retain all three prior tests. Independent full-subset/unit-cell references check 250 seeded inputs at all five capacities; 120 larger controls check feasibility and certificates. Python Bellman-Ford successive shortest paths and independent browser subset enumeration/Floyd-Warshall agree on 24 full reports, 113 interval rows, 124 segments, 120 frontier entries, 222 network edges and 241 residual arcs. Chrome checks every displayed row, timeline geometry, stale/invalid state, 320/390/1280px containment and two trusted exports replayed through native CLI. Separate isolated API/module/console and original eleven-module wheel checks pass.

At most 12 supplied intervals and cap 0..4, with integer endpoints and penalties. Half-open touching spans share a hypothetical lane; zero-length points consume no cap by explicit convention. Primary penalty ties use the smallest retained input-order bitmask, not all primary optima. No trace deletion, inferred real workers, dependency-safe cancellation, counterfactual duration, measured savings or quality claim. Established fixed-interval flow method with credited sources, original implementation and synthetic fixtures.

**[PromptGuard: an allowance is not unlimited](https://github.com/midya8/promptguard)**

An opt-in actual-scanner baseline limits how many equal-identity findings can be suppressed. One prior allowance suppresses one of three current occurrences; two remain reported, while the legacy set suppresses all three. Inspect exact path/severity identity, every before/after allowance, unused entry and gate decision. The original scanner patterns, v1 baseline and prior policy inspector stay unchanged.

100 Python tests retain all 87 prior tests byte-for-byte; seven Node/actual-Chrome tests retain all three originals. Independent occurrence-rank references cover 4,374 exhaustive controls, 200 seeded complete native/browser reports and 162 browser duplicate-count controls. All 24 complete reports include 52 current rows, 32 prior rows, 22 quota entries, 52 legacy-control rows and 104 SVG marks. Chrome checks every displayed row, full selected record, gate/payload, stale/invalid state, 320/390/1280 containment and two trusted exports replayed through native CLI. Separate installed API/module/console reproduces all reports and actual scanner duplicate-contact gates, plus the original eight-module wheel, 27 audits, adapters and offline demo.

Exact path spelling is not repository isolation. Equal-identity occurrences are interchangeable, not historically tracked: reordering can change which line survives. A manually editable quota is not acceptance provenance or safety; a hash is not anonymity. No new detection patterns, security-effectiveness or new-method claim, and no automatic v1 migration. Missing/malformed quotas fail closed; incomplete scans cannot write quotas. Atomic replacement preserves previous quota bytes on a write/replace failure. Public fixtures use only abstract tags and reserved-domain contacts; real witnesses remain private.

**[ScratchGPT](https://github.com/midya8/scratchgpt)**

NumPy GPT/autograd with validated exact continuation: both PCG64 streams, Adam
buffers/clock, data identity, options and runtime metadata. All 13 restart
boundaries match complete state in the same environment; RNG-reset and missing
moment controls expose failures. Independent scalar Adam and transformer
inference drive an [offline replay](https://midya8.github.io/scratchgpt/) with
all coordinates, editable contexts and JSON exports. 70 Python tests preserve
11 originals; three Node/Chrome tests and installed-wheel reproduction. The
historical 419,328-parameter Shakespeare checkpoint is unchanged. The replay is
a separate synthetic model; the browser does not train. No cross-machine
bitwise or new performance claim.

Actual [activation rematerialization](https://midya8.github.io/scratchgpt/remat.html) now recomputes original NumPy transformer blocks during backward with upstream VJPs, guarded state and additive parameter/input gradients. A separate browser scalar-autograd GPT runs full backward, not stored gradients. 111 Python/eight Node tests retain all prior tests; 18 complete witnesses, 15,184 parameter positions, 61,888 cross-runtime fields, Chrome 106,288 table cells and two real downloads replayed natively. Every original 419,328-parameter checkpoint gradient is checked for both groupings, without retraining. Logical graph counts only, not RSS/peak memory/speed. Deterministic dropout=0, first-order only; original trainer and continuation unchanged. [Contract](https://github.com/midya8/scratchgpt/blob/master/REMATERIALIZATION.md).

**[sre-toolkit](https://github.com/midya8/sre-toolkit)**

Dependency-free Python utilities for day-to-day SRE work: error-budget and
burn-rate math with exhaustion projection, multi-window burn-rate alerting
with custom rules, alert triage with fire counts, noisiest-first noise
ranking and critical-driven inhibition with custom rule files, SLO definitions (Markdown or JSON), status
reports with budget-exhaustion projections, and postmortems with automatic
response
metrics and per-severity MTTR aggregation with p90 percentiles, plus
fleet-wide roll-ups across incident sets (report summaries, triage by
severity, metrics by service), bounded, reasoned alert silences, and
burn-rate policy suggestion (--suggest emits the standard multi-window
table for any SLO window), postmortem action-item follow-through
(open items per incident, stale-flagged and gate-able via exit codes), and
burn-rule time-series replay (firing intervals per rule over a timestamped
series, for alert-policy tuning), and alert ownership routing
(services mapped to owning teams with an explicit default; per-team
roll-ups, worst severity first). CLI and
importable
library, 254 unit tests,
CI across Python 3.10-3.13.

**[loglens](https://github.com/midya8/loglens)**

Access-log analysis for the first five minutes of an incident: error rate,
status distribution, hottest failing paths, and the source IPs behind 5xxs,
plus incident timelines, p50/p95/p99 latency, time-window filtering, per-path
breakdowns, a 2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx status-class roll-up, method, user-agent and
referer
triage behind 5xxs, a listing of the individual requests behind
the 5xxs, hour-of-day pattern breakdowns, consecutive-bucket spike
windows, throughput and fixed-bucket latency-distribution reports,
response-size (bandwidth) analysis, baseline-log comparison, Apdex
user-satisfaction scoring (overall and per-path, with a --min-apdex
pipeline gate), a failing-path status pivot (per-endpoint status-code
counts), and
Markdown incident
reports with spike windows and before/after deploy comparisons. Status and
time-window filters scope every statistic. Parses nginx/Apache combined and
JSON logs with per-line auto-detection, standard library only,
241 unit tests.

**[flowkit](https://github.com/midya8/flowkit)**

Dependency-free workflow runner: JSON-defined DAGs of shell commands with
retries and exponential backoff, per-attempt timeouts, fail-fast or
continue-on-error semantics, parallel execution of independent steps,
conditional steps and subset runs, end-phase hook steps
(trigger: on_failure, on_success or finally) for outcome-pinned
cleanup/notify work, and a
dry-run plan mode. Layered flow/step environment variables interpolate into
commands with a strict pre-run check, and run reports show captured output
tails (text or JSON, optionally written to a report file, with full
per-step logs on disk). Definitions are
validated up front (duplicates, dangling dependencies, cycles) and run in
deterministic topological order. Standard
library only, 123 unit tests, CI across Python 3.10-3.13.

**[uptimekit](https://github.com/midya8/uptimekit)**

Synthetic uptime monitoring and availability reporting in pure Python:
HTTP, TCP and TLS certificate-expiry probes with latency, keyword and
latency assertions, an append-only JSONL history with atomic retention,
availability roll-ups with p50/p95 latency, per-day trends and
window-over-window comparison, incident detection with a flap guard and a
sustained-outage gate, a watch mode for cron-less hosts, and a
self-contained HTML status-page renderer. SLO targets report error budget consumed and met-or-breached status, with a `--fail-slo` gate that exits 1 on breach. `check` exits 1 on any failure
so cron doubles as alerting. Standard library only,
98 unit tests running fully offline.

### CutLab response-path extension

[Open the exact response-path inspector](https://midya8.github.io/cutlab/path.html) · [Source and method](https://github.com/midya8/cutlab/blob/main/PATH.md)

Vary binary unary costs with a rational parameter and retain the complete optimum family on every closed region, open cell and breakpoint, including point-only optima and persistent ties. Every assignment keeps its affine line and every line comparison keeps its exact inequality. Independent graph-cut audits check all boundary and cell witnesses.

18 synthetic controls retain 214 assignment lines, 6,084 inequalities and 92 full flow/cut witnesses. Mixed-sign slopes include a label that leaves and returns: no nested-label or scalable parametric-maxflow guarantee is claimed. The inspector enumerates all 2^n assignments for at most six variables. Original flow/cut functionality and tests remain.


### Diagnoselab: all conflicts, all minimal repairs

[Exact logical consistency inspector](https://midya8.github.io/diagnoselab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/diagnoselab)

Full relative MUS/MCS families, bidirectional minimal hitting-set intersections, per-member minimality/unique-hit witnesses and exact rational removal costs. Every soft subset retains its DPLL/unit trace and independent full truth-table models. The smallest repair need not be cheapest; an inconsistent fixed background has no soft repair.

18 original synthetic controls retain 827 subsets, 1,301 search nodes, 20 cores and 52 repairs. 17 Python tests on 3.10-3.13, four Node/Chrome tests, 74,292 exact cross-language scalar checks and installed-wheel reproduction. Exhaustive six-variable/eight-soft-clause bound, established SAT theory, no scalable solver, real fault diagnosis or certified proof claim. No model/API.

[Case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/diagnoselab.md)


#### Diagnoselab repair-policy consequences

[Live query inspector](https://midya8.github.io/diagnoselab/consequences.html) · [Method/sources](https://github.com/midya8/diagnoselab/blob/main/CONSEQUENCES.md)

Distinguishes every/some repair from every/some surviving model, with all tied minimum-cost/cardinality policies, complete countermodels and negated-query DPLL traces. Shared-clause intersection is a separate baseline with strict counterexamples. No-repair families are inapplicable, not vacuous certainty. 26 new exact reports (16,165 scalar leaves), 67 repairs, 78 policy records and 151 full DPLL nodes including intersection baselines; 24 Python/eight Node-Chrome tests preserve all originals. Installed-wheel reproduction and mobile/table/export checks. Finite propositional reasoning, not a database/DL engine or probability claim.


## ArgumentLab: defense, not a vote

[Source](https://github.com/midya8/argumentlab) · [Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/argumentlab/) · [Method and six sources](https://github.com/midya8/argumentlab/blob/main/METHOD.md) · [Case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/argumentlab.md)

An exact bounded abstract-argumentation workbench. Compare all nine extension families, inspect every subset's attackers/defenders and unanswered attacks, all inclusion/range witnesses, complete three-valued labellings and the entire grounded fixed-point chain. Directed graph keeps opposite attacks and self loops visible. Acceptance retains witnesses and counterexamples, with a prominent classical skeptical-vacuity warning when no stable extension exists.

Original strict controls distinguish preferred from maximum cardinality, preferred intersection from grounded, a nonadmissible preferred intersection, and stage from semi-stable. Independent Python bitsets and JavaScript sets agree on all531 directed frameworks through three arguments/344,023 scalar leaves and19 retained full reports/152,884 leaves. Separate set/ternary oracles cover120 native and100 JavaScript seeded larger cases.19 native tests run on four Python versions; five Node/actual-Chrome tests check every retained UI record and graph state, export/invalid clearing and all19 controls at320/390/1280. Installed wheel reproduces19 full reports outside the checkout.

Eight arguments; exhaustive subsets; all ties retained. Established semantics, not a novel/scalable solver, probability model, benchmark win, real-world truth or debate winner. Six inspected sources and exact parser differences documented; no external solver code/data/examples copied or affiliation with existing ArguLab/ARGTEACH.


### ArgumentLab attack switches

[Live switch-cube inspector](https://midya8.github.io/argumentlab/switches.html) · [Source and method](https://github.com/midya8/argumentlab/blob/main/SWITCHES.md)

Enumerates every configuration of up to six supplied attack switches. Preserves all nearest ties, all inclusion-minimal matches, exact extension gains/losses and complete selected-framework defense witnesses. Original controls distinguish minimum cardinality from inclusion minimality and retain nonmonotone and nullable outcomes.

Verified on 21 controls, 209 configurations, 5,205 subset classifications and 423 switch transitions. Independent Python and JavaScript engines, installed CLIs, browser exports and responsive inspection. These are bounded hypothetical edits, not causal effects, persuasion advice or a scalable solver.


## ConceptLab: exact concepts and implication witnesses

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/conceptlab/) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/conceptlab) | [Method and prior work](https://github.com/midya8/conceptlab/blob/main/METHOD.md)

A bounded knowledge-representation workbench for formal concept analysis. Independent Python and JavaScript enumerate every formal concept, cover, meet/join, attribute closure and object derivation. Inspect canonical implications, pseudo-intent decisions, NextClosure pivots, forward rule traces and rule-removal countermodels. Every implication query retains supporting and counterexample rows; an empty premise extent means vacuous validity and null confidence, not evidence.

Fourteen original controls include duplicate rows, zero support, empty universes, strict joins, nonminimal pseudo-intents and multi-rule closure. The retained suite covers 194 attribute subsets, 390 object subsets, 69 concepts, 30 canonical rules, 635 ordered lattice operations and 5,762 implication queries. Independent set-based checks cover all 689 contexts with zero to three objects/attributes plus 100 seeded larger contexts per engine. Native CLI, installed wheel and actual-Chrome checks accompany the interactive inspector.

Finite exact teaching/audit tool: at most six attributes and eight objects. Not learned prediction, fuzzy concept analysis, noisy-data inference, causality or a scalable mining system. Existing FCA theory and software are attributed; no new algorithm is claimed.


### ConceptLab incomplete-context completions

[Live completion inspector](https://midya8.github.io/conceptlab/partial.html) | [Semantics and sources](https://github.com/midya8/conceptlab/blob/main/PARTIAL.md)

Unknown is not false. Enumerate every compatible binary completion of a three-valued table. Inspect certain, contingent and impossible implications, all object counterexamples, exact defined row-confidence bounds and endpoint ties, with zero-support completions kept separate. Intersect goals in one shared completion and retain every inclusion-minimal impossible goal set with deletion witnesses.

Original controls expose two traps: both extreme fill-ins can pass while an intermediate world refutes an implication, and separately possible goals can be jointly impossible. Overlapping-premise tautologies, empty universes, duplicate objects and all 64 worlds of six unknowns remain explicit. Twelve controls cover 86 completions, 438 implication queries, 4,634 query/completion witness rows and 63 goal subsets.

Independent Python and JavaScript engines, 17 native tests on four Python versions, six Node/Chrome tests and 26 installed-wheel reports preserve the complete-context workbench. Every retained UI record, export and invalid-input clearing is checked; all controls are layout-tested at 320/390/1280. Limits: four attributes, four objects, six unknown cells. Completion counts are not probabilities; confidence bounds describe supplied rows, not unseen data. No imputation, causal claim, graded possibility model, incomplete-context basis or new algorithm is claimed.


### STRIPSLab exact planning and relaxation witnesses

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/stripslab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/stripslab) · [Method and prior work](https://github.com/midya8/stripslab/blob/main/METHOD.md)

An original bounded classical-AI planning lab: audit every state and every blocked/applicable action, compare exact real and delete-relaxed shortest-plan families, and inspect h-max/h-add fixed-point rounds and tied fact achievers. Strict controls expose shared-effect double counting, relaxed solvability hiding real dead ends, restoration costs, all shortest-order ties and unreachable cyclic prerequisites. Python bitsets/reverse BFS and independent JavaScript sets/Bellman sweeps reproduce the same complete reports.

Six facts, eight grounded positive-precondition unit-cost actions. No PDDL parser, real-world execution, scalable-planner claim or new planning algorithm. Fourteen original synthetic tasks; eight Python tests, three Node/Chrome tests and isolated wheel reproduction of all fourteen full reports. Established STRIPS and heuristic-planning work is attributed with inspected-source limits.

[STRIPSLab case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/stripslab.md)


### STRIPSLab search witnesses: an actual suboptimal h-add plan

[Inspect four complete search runs](https://midya8.github.io/stripslab/search.html) · [Search policy and reproducible evidence](https://github.com/midya8/stripslab/blob/main/SEARCH.md)

The new A*/best-first inspector exposes every selected frontier, strict cost improvement, applicable action decision and returned plan. A controlled task returns cost 3 with h-add versus exact cost 2 under the disclosed tie and goal-pop policy. Zero, h-max and exact h-plus return cost 2. Includes admissibility/consistency diagnostics, unsolvable exhaustion, strict CLI certificates, an independently implemented browser engine, and a separate synthetic reopening test. Full-state precomputation is explicit: this is a bounded audit, not a planner speedup or new algorithm claim.


### STRIPSLab availability: used does not mean necessary

[Live action-availability inspector](https://midya8.github.io/stripslab/sensitivity.html) | [Exact source and policy](https://github.com/midya8/stripslab/blob/main/SENSITIVITY.md)

Disable every static action subset. Keep every exact counterfactual distance, shortest-plan count, original action ID, representative and optimal edge. Separate an action used by one representative from one required by every optimal plan or every valid plan. Retain all inclusion-minimal sufficient sets and all solvability/optimality cuts, with independently checked minimal-hitting-set duals.

The original duplicate-shortcut control leaves a longer detour when both shortcuts are removed: optimality fails before solvability does. Eighteen controls retain 466 scenarios, 21,731 state rows and 408 optimal edges. Python BFS and independent JavaScript distance sweeps agree on 118 complete reports covering 2,515 scenarios; independent native set-transition and all-proper-subset oracles cover another 80 seeded tasks. Seventeen native tests, nine Node/Chrome tests and 47 isolated installed reports preserve all earlier modes. Browser checks every retained scenario at 320/390/1280.

Six facts/eight unit-cost grounded actions maximum. Static deterministic re-planning, not failure probabilities, timed outages, a scalable landmark extractor, real-world reliability or a new algorithm. [Implementation, boundaries and inspected sources](https://github.com/midya8/stripslab/blob/main/SENSITIVITY.md).


## UnifyLab: a binding is not a solution

[Live finite-term inspector](https://midya8.github.io/unifylab/) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/unifylab) | [Method and inspected sources](https://github.com/midya8/unifylab/blob/main/METHOD.md)

An original bounded classical-AI unification lab. Keep every equation rewrite, composed earlier binding, exact constructor clash and zero-based occurs-check cycle path. A normalized simultaneous substitution is applied to every original equation. Alias reversal is not automatically a cycle, and a resource limit never means non-unifiability.

Independent Python and JavaScript engines reproduce 167 complete reports and 270 rewrites. A separate native certificate checker reconstructs local rules without calling the solver; a third lazy-environment oracle tests controls, 600 seeded systems and all 64 term-pool pairs. Seventeen controls retain 38 rewrites, including actual state/result expansion limits. Twelve native tests on Python 3.10-3.13, three Node/Chrome tests and seventeen isolated installed reports through two CLIs in solve/verify modes. Every retained browser step, equation, binding, witness, export and invalid edit is checked, with layouts at 320/390/1280.

Established finite-tree unification, not new theory. Six variables/eight equations, 96 input nodes, 4,096-node state/result budgets and 256 rewrites. No rational trees, higher-order/AC unification, resolution prover, linear-time or benchmark-win claim. Most-generality follows the established rewrite/solved-form theory; bounded ground-factorization tests are not a universal proof. [UnifyLab case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/unifylab.md).


## UnifyLab: minimal equation conflicts and deletion repairs

[Live subset inspector](https://midya8.github.io/unifylab/cores.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/unifylab) · [Method and inspected sources](https://github.com/midya8/unifylab/blob/main/SUBSETS.md)

Test every indexed subset, keep duplicate equation identities, and distinguish an inclusion-minimal conflict from a smallest conflict. Confirmed deletion repairs list indices to REMOVE and failing single restorations. The default control has independent duplicate/cycle conflicts and repairs of different sizes. A resource limit stays unresolved: no inferred status, false inconsistency, complete-frontier or minimum-size claim. Any selected subsystem opens its detailed rewrite trace.

Eight synthetic controls cover 371 subsets, including all 256 masks at the eight-equation bound, real state/result limits and a known clash beside an unknown expansion. Independent Python/JavaScript engines match 108 full audits and 1,032 subset summaries. Nineteen native tests pass on Python 3.10-3.13; six Node/Chrome tests. Native tests use a third lazy-binding oracle, all proper subsets and independent minimal hitting-set enumeration. Actual Chrome checks every control/subset/neighbor at 320/390/1280, five linked rewrite reproductions, export and invalid-state clearing. Installed wheels reproduce seventeen base reports and eight subset audits through both entry points outside the checkout.

Established finite-tree and constraint-diagnosis concepts, not a new scalable MUS/MCS algorithm. At most 256 independent bounded solves; the aggregate is not an independently verified rewrite certificate. Eight inspected sources distinguish minimal from minimum, conflict from repair, and unifiability semantics from resource limits. No model, API, paid service or private dataset.


## UnifyLab: repeated differences, shared variables

[Ground generalization inspector](https://midya8.github.io/unifylab/generalize.html) · [Method and inspected sources](https://github.com/midya8/unifylab/blob/main/GENERALIZATION.md) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/unifylab)

Finite ground-term anti-unification: keep common constructors and give the same ordered disagreement pair the same variable. Inspect fresh/reuse records, two substitution maps and exact reconstructions. The independent native checker rejects coherent overgeneralization even when both inputs reconstruct. Python and independently written JavaScript agree on 209 reports; nine synthetic controls expose 43 node records. Original solver and subset inspectors retained.

27 native tests, nine Node/Chrome tests, installed wheel checks through both CLI entry points and responsive 320/390/1280 inspection. Established syntactic anti-unification, not a new algorithm, semantic clone detector or code repair model. Ground finite trees only; the checker validates the canonical trace, not arbitrary renamed certificates or a formal proof.


## HornLab: a circle is not a proof

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/hornlab/) · [Source and tests](https://github.com/midya8/hornlab) · [Method and sources](https://github.com/midya8/hornlab/blob/main/METHOD.md)

Bounded positive propositional Horn inference with synchronous derivation rounds and every indexed rule decision. Compare the least model with every classical and supported model: a supported circular assignment need not have a derivation. Inspect an atomic countermodel for each non-entailed query and every inclusion-minimal initial-fact support, including its deletion failures and all seed subsets. Not entailed does not mean classically false.

Independent Python bitsets and JavaScript sets match 210 full reports; a separate native set/truth-table checker replays the complete report. Ten original controls, exhaustive two-atom programs, seeded tests, installed-wheel reproduction and actual Chrome record checks. Six atoms/eight rules, no negation or variables; established semantics, not a new algorithm or production rule engine.


## HornLab: every route, every break

[Rule-deletion inspector](https://midya8.github.io/hornlab/rules.html) · [Method and primary sources](https://github.com/midya8/hornlab/blob/main/RULES.md) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/hornlab)

Keep initial facts fixed and inspect all indexed-rule subsets, synchronous closures, every minimal rule support and every minimal deletion set. One broken route need not break the goal. Each support retains one-rule removal failures; each deletion retains restoration successes. Both minimal-hitting-set dualities and every support/deletion intersection are explicit, including empty-support and already-absent boundary cases.

Eighteen native tests retain all originals, with all 1,024 two-atom programs and 150 seeded rule lattices. Independent Python/JavaScript match 131 audits covering 5,304 subsets. Eleven browser controls expose 305 subsets, 35 queries, 36 supports, 27 deletion sets and 36 intersections, all record-checked at 320/390/1280. A separate native set/truth-table checker validates the complete lattice without calling the generator. Installed-wheel reproduction checks both inspectors through both CLI entry points. Established bounded monotone explanation, not causal attribution, ontology translation, a new algorithm or formal proof.


### BisimLab: same traces, different choices

[Source](https://github.com/midya8/bisimlab) · [Interactive inspector](https://midya8.github.io/bisimlab/) · [Method](https://github.com/midya8/bisimlab/blob/main/METHOD.md)

Finite agent-protocol equivalence from scratch: every strong-bisimulation refinement, every failed left/right step match, executable Hennessy-Milner witness DAGs, truth sets and a quotient graph. The default original control has equal finite trace languages but loses a choice after the same action; exact paired-subset BFS checks trace equality separately from branching equivalence. A native partition-signature checker never calls the generator, and independent JavaScript matches full reports. Nine native tests include all 512 three-state/one-action graphs against relation enumeration and 100 seeded graphs; three Node/actual-Chrome tests include 593 complete cross-engine reports and every control record at 320/390/1280. Installed-wheel checks cover both CLI entry points outside checkout. One to six states, all labels visible: no silent abstraction, probabilities, policy guarantee, source extraction, new algorithm or formal-proof claim. Established theory and seven inspected sources are attributed in the method.


### BisimLab: complete trace-product replay

[Interactive trace product](https://midya8.github.io/bisimlab/traces.html) | [Source and exact semantics](https://github.com/midya8/bisimlab/blob/main/TRACES.md)

The second inspector retains the entire reachable product of two states' possible successor sets, including every action edge after a mismatch and the both-empty sink. Inspect canonical BFS discovery words, layers, all possibility-mismatch nodes and a shortest distinguishing path. Equal finite traces still do not imply branching equivalence.

Python bitmasks, independent JavaScript sets and a separate native checker based on explicit subset tables agree on 4,715 trace reports. Seventeen native tests include exhaustive unary three-state graphs across every ordered pair, direct word enumeration, seeded multi-action cases and forged closure/provenance checks. Six Node/actual-Chrome tests cover every control record, export and invalid-input clearing at 320/390/1280px. Installed-wheel checks cover six original and seven trace controls, two CLI entry points and six import origins. One to six states, all actions visible; exponential and bounded, with no silent actions, model/API dependency, scalable-solver or new-algorithm claim. Established subset determinisation and product language equivalence are attributed in the source ledger.


### ShieldLab: a safe next step can still lose

[Source](https://github.com/midya8/shieldlab) | [Interactive inspector](https://midya8.github.io/shieldlab/) | [Exact method and seven-source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/shieldlab/blob/main/METHOD.md)

An exact tiny safety-game inspector for hand-written agent protocols. Every synchronous fixed-point obligation, winning controller move, losing rank and branching invariant/counterstrategy graph is visible. Changing only who controls a state flips the result: one-step-safe actions need not preserve safety forever. Independent bitmask Python and explicit-set JavaScript, plus a separate dual-attractor and exhaustive positional-policy checker.

Eight native tests include all 21,952 three-state graph/ownership/safety combinations and 150 seeded larger arenas. Three Node/actual-Chrome tests compare 643 complete reports and all six controls at 320/390/1280. Installed wheels replay both CLI entry points outside checkout. Finite total perfect-information model only: no runtime shield, LLM guarantee, liveness, timing, probability, new algorithm or formal proof. Dead ends are rejected; safe waiting need not mean progress.

### BuchiLab: a winning state is not a winning policy

[Interactive inspector](https://midya8.github.io/buchilab/) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/buchilab) | [Method and seven-source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/buchilab/blob/main/METHOD.md)

Tiny finite adversarial repeated-goal games with every nested greatest/least fixed-point obligation, progress rank, complete positional controller policy and reachable cyclic non-goal SCC visible. Idle can stay inside the winning region forever and still lose: rank-guided progress and per-policy audits show why. A separate checker replays with sets/Floyd reachability and every joint-policy eventual lasso, without calling the generator. Nine native tests include 21,952 exhaustive three-state games; three Node/actual-Chrome tests compare 331 complete Python/JavaScript reports and every control record at 320/390/1280. Installed wheels replay seven original controls through both CLIs outside checkout. No fairness assumption, learned abstraction, deployed shield, general LTL compiler, formal proof or real-agent guarantee. Rank-permitted actions are sufficient, not all winning policies.

### BuchiLab: repeat the actual failure

[Action-level lasso inspector](https://midya8.github.io/buchilab/lassos.html) | [Exact witness contract](https://github.com/midya8/buchilab/blob/main/LASSOS.md)

A reachable bad component now becomes an exact action-labelled prefix once and nonempty non-goal cycle forever, for every failing fixed controller policy/root. Empty prefixes, self-loops, multiedge cycles, unreachable bad components and duplicate-target action choices are explicit. BFS generation is independently checked with bounded simple walks and the joint-policy lasso oracle. Original v1 reports and original tests stay intact: 16 native tests across four Python versions and five Node/actual-Chrome tests, including 314 complete witness-report comparisons and every record in ten controls at 320/390/1280. Installed wheels replay both report families outside checkout. Input-order anchor, shortest prefix/cycle individually, not globally shortest lasso. These are per-policy counterexamples, not one environment strategy defeating every controller policy or a real-agent guarantee.

## HallLab: distinct is a global promise

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/halllab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/halllab) · [Method and six-source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/halllab/blob/main/METHOD.md)

Tiny constraint-based AI assignment, with every supported variable/value backed by a complete injective assignment and every rejected edge explained by a forced-residual Hall obstruction. A full synchronous pairwise-AC baseline makes the global bottleneck visible. Exact matching/counting, independent exhaustive native checker, separate JavaScript assignment engine, editable graphs, all tight/deficient subsets and every propagation round.

12 native tests include 8,777 exhaustive domain graphs; 682 complete cross-engine reports; actual Chrome checks every control edge/subset/round at 320/390/1280. Fresh installed CLI replay. Original synthetic controls, no learned model or paid API. At most six variables/eight values, one constraint: not an optimized Régin SCC propagator, scalability benchmark or whole-CSP solver.


### HallLab: local support is not a shared solution

[Overlapping-scope inspector](https://midya8.github.io/halllab/overlaps.html) · [Exact overlap contract and sources](https://github.com/midya8/halllab/blob/main/OVERLAPS.md) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/halllab)

Repeat full local all-different propagation to a synchronous fixed point, then compare it with exact common-assignment support across overlapping scopes. A two-color triangle keeps every local value but has no joint assignment. A satisfiable triangle keeps local values that never occur in a common solution. Inspect each round, original-variable mappings, scope-only witnesses, full common witnesses and exhaustive rejection bins.

Separate native API/module CLI, independent report checker and JavaScript engine. Eight new native tests and three new Node/Chrome tests preserve the original test sources. Full cross-engine checks cover 621 overlap reports; nine browser controls run at 320/390/1280 widths. Installed-wheel checks run outside the checkout. Tiny exact reference: six variables, eight values, six scopes, at most 262144 full tuples. Classic consistency theory, not a scalable CP solver or a new algorithm.


### HallLab: every minimal conflict, every minimal removal

[Live conflict inspector](https://midya8.github.io/halllab/conflicts.html) · [Exact contract and seven-source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/halllab/blob/main/CONFLICTS.md) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/halllab)

All inclusion-minimal conflicting all-different scope sets and all inclusion-minimal scope-removal repairs, with complete single-deletion witnesses, common kept-network assignments and contained conflicts for every restoration. The default diamond has a size-one and four size-two minimal removals: minimal is not minimum. Inspect every active subset and the hitting-set intersections that explain why a repair must break every conflict. Domains stay fixed; an empty-domain background has no scope-removal repair.

Independent native histogram generation, per-subset product verification and recursive JavaScript search. 28 native tests, nine Node/actual-Chrome tests; 621 cross-engine reports and 4413 active subsets. Installed wheel reproduces all three report families outside checkout. Prior implementations/tests retained. All browser controls/proofs checked at 320/390/1280. Tiny exact relations, not a scalable MUS/MCS solver, weighted optimizer or a new duality theorem.


## STNLab - temporal bounds with attainable schedules

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/stnlab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/stnlab) · [Method and source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/stnlab/blob/main/METHOD.md) · [Case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/stnlab.md)

For tiny hand-written AI plans, inspect every implied time difference: a tight path plus a complete schedule attaining the bound, or an explicit ray proving it unbounded. Negative cycles show exactly why no schedule exists, even away from the anchor. Removing one edge returns an alternate implication path or a complete separating schedule. Eleven editable controls include duplicate edges, zero cycles, free components and a chain with bound 100.

Native Floyd-Warshall/Bellman-Ford generation, independent permutation/edge-product verification and recursive browser search agree. Nine native tests cover exhaustive tiny graphs, seeded networks and strict CLI rejection; real Chrome checks all proof panels at three widths. Six points and twelve constraints, real-valued times, no resource capacity, uncertain durations or execution guarantee. Classic temporal-network theory, not a new optimization algorithm.


## STNLab insertion sensitivity

One proposed temporal constraint, an exact consistency threshold and every changed implied bound. [Source](https://github.com/midya8/stnlab) · [Insertion inspector](https://midya8.github.io/stnlab/insertions.html) · [Contract and source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/stnlab/blob/main/INSERTIONS.md).

Native old-matrix one-edge closure is checked against independent full recomputation. Inspect the old return path, a complete schedule at the feasibility boundary, a candidate-first negative cycle, or a still-unbounded anchored ray. All finite post-insertion bounds include attaining schedules; 41 integer weights are separate alternatives, not accumulated changes.

Ten new synthetic controls include exact-boundary feasibility, a missing return path, a pre-inconsistent base, duplicate/self-loop cases, a six-point threshold outside the input window and a 12-edge base plus candidate. The original inspector remains intact. Seventeen Python tests, six Node/real-Chrome tests and installed-wheel checks cover both families. This is bounded classical temporal reasoning, not event execution, uncertainty handling, a new algorithm or a scalable verifier.


### STNLab existential projection

[Interactive projection lab](https://midya8.github.io/stnlab/projection.html) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/stnlab) | [Exact contract](https://github.com/midya8/stnlab/blob/main/PROJECTION.md)

Hide time points without losing the bounds their paths imply. STNLab restricts the closed network to retained original IDs, lifts jointly feasible retained assignments into full original schedules, and exposes retained assignments that naive edge deletion wrongly permits. Each finite projected bound has an original path and a full attaining schedule; unbounded pairs have anchored rays. Hidden negative cycles remain impossible.

Independent Fourier-Motzkin elimination, path enumeration and pinned-cycle checks audit the result. Native Python and separate browser recomputation agree across 12 projection controls, with installed CLI reproduction and real Chrome proof-panel tests at 320, 390 and 1280 pixels. Classical STN analysis over real-valued time points, not a new algorithm, calendar executor or uncertainty model.


## STNLab complete conflicts and repairs

[Live conflict/repair inspector](https://midya8.github.io/stnlab/conflicts.html) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/stnlab) | [Exact contract and sources](https://github.com/midya8/stnlab/blob/main/CONFLICTS.md)

Enumerate every inclusion-minimal temporal conflict and every inclusion-minimal correction set. Replay negative cycles, conflict-deletion schedules, repaired schedules and restoration contradictions. An independent native verifier checks complete hitting-set duality; a separate JavaScript engine powers the inspector. Minimal is explicitly distinct from minimum-cardinality.

Validation: 31 native tests on Python 3.10-3.13, 12 Node/Chrome tests, 316 cross-engine reports, exhaustive tiny networks and installed-wheel reproduction for all four STNLab families. Chrome visits every control proof at 320/390/1280. Includes duplicate edges, disconnected conflicts, self-loops, empty repairs and the 12-edge boundary. Classical duality applied to bounded STNs, not a new-theory or scalable-solver claim.


## EUFLab: ground equality with evidence

[Live proof and countermodel inspector](https://midya8.github.io/euflab/) | [Source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/euflab) | [Semantics and six-source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/euflab/blob/main/METHOD.md)

Functions preserve equality, not difference. EUFLab exposes ground congruence proof DAGs, every contradicted disequality and a total finite interpretation for consistent inputs. Inspect non-injectivity, cyclic values, duplicate syntax, ordered arguments and inconsistent-premise boundaries. Native union-find/proof forests, separate browser relation saturation, independent proof/model verification and exhaustive set-partition references make the claims inspectable.

Validation: 9 native tests on Python 3.10-3.13; 156 cross-engine reports; 251 query selections at each of 320, 390 and 1280 pixels; installed-wheel generation and verification through both entry points. Bounded ground conjunctions only, not quantified logic, arithmetic, SMT-LIB parsing or a production SMT solver. No model service or paid API.


## EUFLab finite-model atlas

[Live finite-model atlas](https://midya8.github.io/euflab/atlas.html) | [Source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/euflab) | [Exact atlas contract](https://github.com/midya8/euflab/blob/main/ATLAS.md)

The most separated quotient is not necessarily the smallest model. EUFLab now enumerates every compatible term-equality pattern, finds minimum domain size, and classifies each pair as forced equal, forced different or flexible. Explore total model witnesses, unary backward difference, binary disjunctions, odd-cycle coloring and all 4,140 eight-name patterns. Counts are equality patterns, not full interpretations; extra unnamed domain elements remain possible.

Independent restricted-growth, explicit-block and subset-cover enumerators. Validation preserves the original nine native tests: 16 native tests on Python 3.10-3.13, six Node/Chrome tests, 76 complete cross-engine atlas reports, installed-wheel reproduction of both inspector families, and all 4,317 admitted control patterns at 320/390/1280 pixels. Exhaustive ground-conjunction search, capped at eight terms; no scalability or new-algorithm claim.


## EUFLab domain-cap debugger

[Live bounded-domain debugger](https://midya8.github.io/euflab/cardinality.html) | [Source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/euflab) | [Exact diagnosis contract](https://github.com/midya8/euflab/blob/main/CARDINALITY.md)

Too few values? Find every cause. With the domain cap held fixed, enumerate every inclusion-minimal assertion conflict and deletion repair. Separate intrinsic inconsistency from cap-only conflicts, inspect every assertion subset, and replay total models for repairs or one-literal core relaxations. Duplicate occurrences retain their identities; minimal repairs need not have minimum size. A three-cycle shows why explicit difference-edge coloring alone misses functional constraints.

Validation: 23 native tests on Python 3.10-3.13, nine Node/Chrome tests, 269 complete cross-engine reports, independent labeled-assignment and hitting-set references, and installed-wheel reproduction of all three inspector families. Chrome audits 379 subset selections, 36 core-relaxation actions, 29 repair actions and 104 cap changes at each of 320/390/1280 pixels. Eight terms, eight assertion occurrences, ground conjunctions only. Complete bounded enumeration, not a new algorithm or scalability claim.


## EUFLab costed repair planner

[Live planner](https://midya8.github.io/euflab/planner.html) · [Source and exact contract](https://github.com/midya8/euflab/blob/main/PLANNER.md)

Protect what cannot change, price what can. The fourth EUFLab inspector enumerates every permitted deletion set, every cost-only optimum and a separate cost/count Pareto frontier. Protected intrinsic or cap-only cores explain infeasibility. Each plan includes a total minimum-domain model with kept, protected and omitted assertion truth rows.

Zero-cost nonminimal ties are preserved, not silently filtered to minimal repairs. Deleting does not mean negating; the live control shows an omitted equality that still holds. Costs never override protection. Fourteen synthetic controls cover different-size/same-cost optima, two-coordinate tradeoffs, duplicate occurrences, hard obstructions and function-driven cardinality.

Native and browser engines agree on 358 complete reports. Independent labeled-domain references check graph/protection policies and functional DAGs; an independent certificate verifier rebuilds models and checks all masks/objectives. Python 3.10-3.13, installed module/console reproduction and actual Chrome phone/desktop checks. Eight terms/eight assertions, ground one-sort conjunctions; no general MaxSMT, new-algorithm or scalability claim. Nothing is actually edited.


### EUFLab exact repair-cost sensitivity

[Live sensitivity inspector](https://midya8.github.io/euflab/sensitivity.html) | [Source and certificate contract](https://github.com/midya8/euflab/blob/main/SENSITIVITY.md)

Vary one assertion deletion cost over every integer from 0 to 1,000,000. The certificate gives exact keep/delete intervals, breakpoint ties and every optimum mask, including zero-cost nonminimal repairs. An independent native verifier rebuilds all affine plan-cost lines; the browser inspector audits replacement costs, regret and total models without treating omitted assertions as negated. Hard protections and blocked policies remain explicit. This is bounded exhaustive analysis, not an industrial-scale solver or simultaneous multi-cost robustness guarantee.


### DFALab: active learning with exact counterexamples

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/dfalab/) | [Source and contract](https://github.com/midya8/dfalab/blob/main/CONTRACT.md) | [Case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/dfalab.md)

Ask membership questions, repair an observation table, then break a wrong conjecture with a shortest counterexample. Classic Angluin L* is replayed with every experiment, closure/consistency witness and complete reachable-product equivalence check. The final DFA has access words and pair-separating suffixes proving minimality. Independent Python/JavaScript reports and a separate certificate checker are tested against exhaustive tiny teachers and a pair-marking oracle. Exact equivalence relies on the supplied finite synthetic teacher, not random tests of a real service; no new algorithm or query-efficiency claim.

### DFALab: bounded conformance, not an unrestricted test-pass claim

[Live W-method inspector](https://midya8.github.io/dfalab/conformance.html) | [Construction, assumptions and sources](https://github.com/midya8/dfalab/blob/main/CONFORMANCE.md) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/dfalab)

The classic DFA W-method now has a complete experiment inspector: every state-cover word, middle word, distinguishing suffix, canonical factor and acceptance path. It separates four claims: finite suite agreement, the supplied candidate's reachable-state bound, a bounded equivalence certificate and a separate exact graph audit. A faulty extra-state candidate passes when its bound is understated; increasing the bound exposes the fault. Tests do not infer a hidden service's state count.

An independent verifier reconstructs all factor combinations and checks every output and witness without calling the generator. Six added native tests include 52,488 exhaustive reference/candidate cases; 131 full native/browser-engine reports are cross-checked. Actual Chrome audits 3,444 test selections and 141 probes across eleven controls and three widths. Four Python versions, seven Node/Chrome checks and installed two-family reproduction preserve the original L* learning page and schema. These are synthetic fixture checks, not production-protocol benchmarks or a new theorem. The method is credited to Vasilevskii and Chow; the precise DFA theorem and reset/state-bound assumptions are documented.

### DFALab: exhaustive finite fault atlas and exact test-subset selection

[Live fault atlas](https://midya8.github.io/dfalab/fault-atlas.html) | [Exact domain, cost and sources](https://github.com/midya8/dfalab/blob/main/FAULT_ATLAS.md) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/dfalab)

Enumerate every complete labeled implementation in a tiny unary/binary state domain, distinguish equivalent survivors from real faults, and inspect every acceptance-matrix row. Every subset of the constructed W-suite is checked under test-count then letter-count cost. All minima, escaping faults and chosen-test deletion witnesses are retained. Irredundancy is not confused with minimum cardinality; label/unreachable-state duplicates are not counted as unique languages or bug frequencies.

An independent native verifier reconstructs the complete machine domain and every subset result. Tests cover all 60 tiny minimal references with a separate equivalence oracle. Eleven complete cross-engine atlas reports match; actual Chrome audits 6,996 candidate selections and 804 subset selections across eight controls and three widths. All eighteen native checks on four Python versions, ten Node/Chrome checks and installed three-family reproduction preserve active learning and bounded conformance. Optimization is restricted to subsets of the generated W-suite, not globally shortest tests or real-world protocol coverage. Classic W-method and set-cover ideas are explicitly credited.


### SynthLab: counterexample-guided bit-vector program synthesis


**Fits the examples. Fails the function.** A learner chooses the cheapest grammar expression fitting known examples; an exact finite verifier returns the first wrong input. Inspect every iteration, eliminated candidate, complete truth table and evaluation tree. Full-domain semantic signatures safely deduplicate programs without using the target; a separate verifier enumerates every raw ordered grammar tree to check bounded completeness and canonical minimum cost.

Ten synthetic controls separate example agreement, exact finite correctness and minimum AST-node cost inside the explicit grammar. Eight native tests run on Python3.10-3.13, including512 Boolean target/grammar pairs and2764 raw trees at each of three widths; four Node/actual-Chrome tests audit30 reports,90 iterations,903 candidate signatures and3420 expression probes. Installed module+console reproduction runs outside the checkout. Classical CEGIS/enumeration credited. No novel algorithm, unbounded synthesis, cvc5 integration or production-code benchmark claim.

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/synthlab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/synthlab) · [Grammar, proof boundary and sources](https://github.com/midya8/synthlab/blob/main/CONTRACT.md)

#### Exact finite teaching-set atlas

**A correct program need not be uniquely identified.** The teaching inspector separates CEGIS correctness from eliminating every rival function. For realizable 1-bit and 2-bit targets it checks every input subset, reports all minimum-cardinality teaching sets and seed-constrained minima, and provides row-deletion rival witnesses. A separate direct-intersection verifier checks the complete atlas, including the embedded raw-AST synthesis certificate.

The two-bit XOR control has 132 distinct rival functions and 65,536 input subsets. CEGIS stops correctly with four examples but leaves three rivals; the atlas finds 182 four-row teaching sets. Same number of examples does not mean the same identifying power. Five teaching controls add seven native tests and three Node/Chrome checks, bringing the project to 15 native tests on Python 3.10-3.13 and seven Node/Chrome checks. Chrome audits 15 teaching reports, 1,203 subset selections and 597 rival truth selections; installed module and console reproduction runs outside the checkout.

[Teaching inspector](https://midya8.github.io/synthlab/teaching.html) · [Teaching contract and sources](https://github.com/midya8/synthlab/blob/main/TEACHING.md) · [Reviewed implementation](https://github.com/midya8/synthlab/pull/2)

Finite target-specific identification, not class-wide teaching dimension or PAC learning. Classical teaching-set/minimum-cover ideas credited to Goldman and Kearns; word-valued labels use explicit equality. No new teaching algorithm claim.

#### Exact adaptive query policies

**Let the answer choose the next question.** The adaptive inspector solves the smallest worst-case number of further input queries needed to identify any function still fitting the initial observations. It audits every nonempty version space, every query's label partition, all tied minimax rows, a canonical policy and every possible target path. A separate verifier checks the complete recurrence and the underlying raw-tree synthesis certificate.

A full seeded two-bit grammar leaves ten functions after two known observations. Two further adaptive queries suffice, while every fixed passive separating set needs three rows. Immediate split balance is not the same objective: across all balanced tie resolutions, policies need two or three further queries. Neither an easier hand-selected class nor an unlucky chosen baseline tie is used.

Seven additional native tests bring the project to 22 on Python 3.10-3.13; five additional Node/Chrome checks bring it to 12. The adaptive tests compare 541 complete native/JavaScript reports with independent verification. Actual Chrome audits 15 adaptive reports, 1,583 version-space selections, 111 query partitions, 306 answer branches, 84 target traces and 105 passive mask selections. Installed module+console reproduction includes all three certificate families outside the checkout.

[Adaptive inspector](https://midya8.github.io/synthlab/adaptive.html) · [Exact adaptive contract and sources](https://github.com/midya8/synthlab/blob/main/ADAPTIVE.md) · [Reviewed implementation](https://github.com/midya8/synthlab/pull/3)

At most ten functions after separately counted initial observations, exact noiseless labels and unit query cost. Future answers are simulated from supplied tables, not a live oracle. Classical decision-tree dynamic programming and generalized binary search credited. No expected-cost, PAC or novel-algorithm claim.

## WarpLab: inspectable differentiable alignment

Soft-DTW without the black box: scalar Python and browser JavaScript expose every Gibbs cell occupancy and joint edge flow, sequence/temperature gradients, and cost Hessian-vector products. A separate exhaustive path oracle checks every report field against all legal alignments.

- Stable log-space messages and directional expectation messages, no autodiff dependency. Cost curvature is checked against negative path-incidence covariance and finite differences.
- Eight synthetic controls include negative self-scores, a single legal path, low-temperature underflow and a 7 by 7 grid where all 8,989 paths tie. Hard ties compare exact rational sums of binary64 local costs, not a fuzzy tolerance.
- Strict JSON certificates, atomic CLI output and fresh installed module/console reproduction. Python 3.10-3.13 CI; 168 complete cross-language reports; real Chrome checks at 320/390/1280 pixels, including cell/edge inspection, complete paths, accessible row/column controls, export and error clearing.

[Live alignment inspector](https://midya8.github.io/warplab/) · [Source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/warplab) · [Mathematical contract](https://github.com/midya8/warplab/blob/main/CONTRACT.md) · [Reviewed implementation](https://github.com/midya8/warplab/pull/1)

Raw soft-DTW is not a metric and can be negative. Occupancy sums to expected path length, not one; it is not a transport coupling. Hessian products are in independent cost coordinates. Lengths are bounded to 1..7; synthetic controls are not accuracy or speed benchmarks. Established soft-DTW and differentiable-DP mathematics credited to Cuturi/Blondel and Blondel/Mensch/Vert. No novel-algorithm or ground-cost-independent divergence theorem claim.

### Path-length atlas

[Live length atlas](https://midya8.github.io/warplab/lengths.html) · [Length contract](https://github.com/midya8/warplab/blob/main/LENGTHS.md) · [Reviewed extension](https://github.com/midya8/warplab/pull/2)

Separate every legal visited-cell count before mixing paths. Length-resolved log messages expose exact path counts, conditional occupancies and joint edge flows, hard minima/ties, and conditional coordinate/temperature gradients. An explicit per-visited-cell penalty changes the mixture, not the conditional laws. Inspect the entropy decomposition, expected-length gradient and negative length-variance curvature.

The extension adds 98 independently verified complete cross-language atlases. Merged main passes 27 Python tests on each Python 3.10-3.13 and nine Node/Chrome tests, plus installed module/console reproduction for eight base and eight length controls. Live Chrome checks 81 length selections, 1,740 row/column cell inspections, 72 penalty changes and 96 complete reports at 320/390/1280 pixels. All ten deployed assets are source-exact; all 48 screenshots across both inspectors match verified main pixel for pixel.

Length includes both endpoints. Positive penalty favors shorter paths, negative penalty rewards longer paths: this is a changed objective, not an accuracy improvement. The independent oracle groups complete paths and checks the penalized law directly; it does not trust the length-message generator. Synthetic grids remain bounded to 1..7 samples, with at most 8,989 paths. No new-algorithm or benchmark claim.

### Inverse expected-length response

[Live inverse inspector](https://midya8.github.io/warplab/inverse.html) · [Inverse contract](https://github.com/midya8/warplab/blob/main/INVERSE.md) · [Reviewed extension](https://github.com/midya8/warplab/pull/3)

Choose a target expected visited-cell count and inspect whether penalty -4..4 can reach it. The full numerical bisection witness exposes every bracket, response, centered length variance and probability law. Finite-range failures, single-length unidentifiability and numerical flattening stay distinct. A narrow-bracket control deliberately misses the mean-residual tolerance, making the difference between stopping rules visible.

A separate complete-path oracle directly evaluates every witness penalty and checks the trace, status and selected response without calling the solver or length dynamic program. Merged main passes 37 Python tests on each Python 3.10-3.13 and 12 Node/Chrome tests. Tests include 36 complete cross-language inverse reports, derivative finite differences, random interior targets, generator-disabled verification and forged witnesses. Fresh installed module/console reproduction covers eight base, eight length and nine inverse controls. Live inverse Chrome checks 438 witness selections over 27 complete reports at 320/390/1280; all 15 deployed assets are source-exact, and all 75 screenshots across the three inspectors match verified main pixel for pixel.

This is bounded numerical evidence, not interval arithmetic or a unique-parameter certificate. A width stop does not promise a 1e-9 mean residual; unreachable targets show a diagnostic response, not a solution. Binary64 rounding can disagree at adversarial branch boundaries, in which case verification fails. No learned model, benchmark or new-algorithm claim.

## HingeLab: a boundary is not always an adversary

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/hingelab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/hingelab) · [Reviewed implementation](https://github.com/midya8/hingelab/pull/1) · [Case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/hingelab.md)

Follow every rational affine region of a small ReLU network. Inspect hidden activation masks, exact decision roots and the full opposite-class set, including open endpoints and isolated ties. The report separates an attained nearest adversary from an unattained distance infimum and checks the actual closed-ball radius. A paired control keeps margin(x) = x fixed and changes only the reference side: the class-1 tie makes radius one robust on one side and nonrobust on the other.

Forward interval splitting is checked by an independent complete activation-mask enumerator that never calls the generator. Python Fraction and browser BigInt engines agree on 144 complete reports. Merged main passes 12 tests on each Python 3.10-3.13, including 200 seeded two-layer networks, generator-disabled verification and forged evidence. Four Node/Chrome tests and fresh installed module/console reproduction cover all eight controls. Live Chrome checks 54 region selections over 24 reports at 320/390/1280, export, stale clearing and invalid input. All five deployed assets are source-exact, and all 24 main/deployed screenshots match pixel for pixel.

This is exact only for the declared small rational, one-dimensional contract, with a fixed class-1 tie convention and explicit domain. SVG coordinates are rounded for display, never used as evidence. No trained model, model import, high-dimensional certificate, benchmark or new-algorithm claim. Established exact line-restriction and verification work is attributed; a downloaded browser report is independently checked only when the Python checker accepts it.

## HingeLab: every reference, one exact radius

[Live reference atlas](https://midya8.github.io/hingelab/reference.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/hingelab) · [Reviewed implementation](https://github.com/midya8/hingelab/pull/2)

Compute the entire robust-reference set, not one sampled point. Exact class-component erosion keeps strict versus closed endpoints, isolated ties and domain-edge clipping. A nested tent's class-1 interval [-1/2, 1/2] at radius 1/2 shrinks to the robust singleton {0}; at 513/1024 it disappears. Its zero interval length never erases its existence. The exact robust-length fraction is not accuracy or a data probability.

A separate activation-mask/critical-atom checker exhausts every boundary/root and radius-shifted transition, without the reference generator or its erosion/union routines. Merged main passes 20 tests on each Python 3.10-3.13 and seven Node/Chrome tests. Evidence includes 160 new seeded networks with point agreement/radius monotonicity, 200 new complete exact Python/BigInt reference reports, 144 preserved base reports, generator-disabled and forged-type checks, and an additional 972-case tiny-network/domain/radius sweep. Fresh installed module/console reproduction covers eight base plus eight reference controls. Live Chrome checks 47 robust-component selections over 28 reference reports, plus 24 base reports, at 320/390/1280. All nine deployed assets match main, and all 52 main/deployed screenshots match pixel for pixel, including singleton, empty, above-threshold and zero-radius states.

The original bounded rational one-dimensional contract and class-1 ties are unchanged. The closed ball is intersected with the declared domain. Established piecewise-affine analysis and set erosion, not a new algorithm, trained/imported model, high-dimensional certificate, sampled-grid proof or benchmark. Browser evidence becomes independently checked only after Python accepts its download.

## HingeLab: every radius, exact

[Live all-radius profile](https://midya8.github.io/hingelab/radius.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/hingelab) · [Radius-profile case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/hingelab.md#radius-profile-extension)

Exact piecewise-linear robust interval length for every radius in [0,32],
class-wise and total existence sets with strict/closed extinction endpoints,
and the first radius at most a requested length fraction. Zero length is not
empty: margin x on [-2,2] retains a robust singleton at radius 2. A separate
mask/atom checker reconstructs the complete profile from candidate collision
radii and opposite-class closed-ball intersection, without importing the
profile/reference generator or erosion/union code. Full exact JSON export.

44 source files verified on merged main `4b1ceacf5ffeeb25ed8052c48053a926e91dd047`.
26 Python tests on each of 3.10-3.13; ten Node/Chrome tests; 104 new complete
cross-language profile reports plus 200 reference and 144 base reports; fresh
installed reproduction for eight controls in each report family. Live Chrome
checks 28 radius, 28 reference and 24 base reports. All 13 deployed assets are
source-exact; all 80 native/feature/main/deployed screenshots match without
masks and final phone/desktop/conditional pixels were inspected. Feature, PR,
main CI and Pages all green. [Merged PR](https://github.com/midya8/hingelab/pull/3).

Deliberately bounded scalar rational ReLU networks, closed balls clipped to the

## RewriteLab: a shortcut can need a larger detour

[Live inspector](https://midya8.github.io/rewritelab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab) · [Case study](https://github.com/midya8/Midya-portfolio/blob/main/projects/rewritelab.md)

Complete bounded arithmetic-rewrite closures, shortest proofs and a separate exhaustive polynomial-semantic optimum. Five nodes block a real simplification; seven unlock its three-rewrite bridge. A weighted control still exposes a cost-7 semantic gap at the seven-node limit. Every reachable proof and semantic candidate is inspectable, with editable occurrence costs and independently checkable JSON evidence.

25 exact source files, 11 Python tests across four versions, three Node/Chrome tests, 72 complete cross-language reports, installed-wheel reproduction and full deployed behavior checks. Separate grammar/rule enumeration and exact degree-bounded interpolation check the evidence. Explicit finite graph, not an e-graph, tensor compiler, floating-point proof or runtime-speedup claim. [Contract](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab/blob/main/CONTRACT.md) · [Sources](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab/blob/main/SOURCES.md).


## RewriteLab budget barriers: when fitting is not reaching

[Live budget-barrier atlas](https://midya8.github.io/rewritelab/barriers.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab) · [Exact filtration contract](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab/blob/main/BARRIERS.md) · [Merged change](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab/pull/2)

The atlas retains every 3/5/7-node closure through the chosen cap and every
polynomial-equivalent candidate. It separates the first budget that fits both
source and target from the first budget that admits a rewrite proof. Each
blocked lower level has a complete closure obstruction, and each first-reachable
level has a shortest proof within that level. Source-too-large and
target-too-large are not mislabeled as blocked.

For `x*(1+1) -> x+x`, first fitting is 5, first reachable is 7, extra budget is
2 and shortest distance is 3. Thirteen of its 213 cap-7 semantic candidates
need a larger bridge. The weighted constant product is still a counter-control:
five of six candidates remain unreached through seven nodes. Leaf `x` first
has allowed budget 3, but its zero-step path has actual peak 1. Null means
not reached through the cap, not impossible at every larger budget.

Independent verification first checks every nested full closure with separate
generic rule templates and exact 25-point degree-bounded signatures, then
independently enumerates candidates and budget labels. It imports no atlas
generator, forward search or coefficient maps; the syntax/size/cost contract
and base independent verifier are shared. A test-only heap directly minimizes
peak-node labels through the independent template graph for all semantic
candidates of six sources.

Fresh public feature/main reproduction: 35 files source-exact; 20 tests on
Python 3.10-3.13; six Node/actual-Chrome tests; installed eight controls per
family through module and console outside the checkout, with forgeries rejected.
36 complete Python/JS atlases compare 13,016 candidate rows and 13,745 nested
proof rows. Chrome checks 25 atlases and every 3,844 candidate selection, all
five level states, three widths, export, cap changes and invalidation. Base
72 full cross-language reports and all base browser checks remain intact.
Feature/PR/main CI and Pages pass; nine deployed assets match main and 57
feature/main/live screenshots match without masks.

This is the least allowed budget in a fixed small grammar, not a new minimax
algorithm, e-graph, learned policy, tensor compiler or runtime benchmark. A
shortest proof at that budget need not be globally shortest across larger
budgets, and its peak need not equal the allowed budget. Reachable and semantic
optima each fall or stay fixed as the budget grows; their difference need not.
No result above the cap or IEEE floating-point equivalence is claimed.


## RewriteLab cost atlas: one graph, every cost tradeoff

[Live cost-weight atlas](https://midya8.github.io/rewritelab/weights.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab) · [Exact weight-box contract](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab/blob/main/WEIGHTS.md) · [Merged change](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab/pull/3)

A fixed rewrite graph can have different cheapest answers under different
operator costs. This atlas keeps all 512 positive integral (+, multiplication,
leaf) weight triples in 1..8. Every semantic expression is retained in an exact
operation-count group, together with its complete reachable subset. Every
outcome retains exact optimum ties and the cost gap. The accessible 8×8 slice
changes leaf cost without running another search; all optimum ties and group
members remain selectable.

For constant four, product vector (2 additions, 1 multiplication, 4 leaves)
competes with addition-only vector (3, 0, 4). They tie exactly when addition
and multiplication costs agree. There are 224 positive-gap triples, 288 with
zero gap and 64 ties. Each semantic group wins at 288 triples because ties
credit both, so win counts are not a probability partition. By contrast, the
five-node bridge source is strictly dominated by blocked `x+x` and has a gap
at all 512 triples. No crossover is invented for a dominated pair.

The independent checker validates a full unit-cost closure, counts canonical
syntax symbols separately from the generator's recursive tree traversal, and
rebuilds every group, reachable subset, weight outcome, tie, gap, dominator
and win count. Shared syntax and base independent closure checking are named
explicitly. All 512 ordinary optimize reports, including full expanded
expression ties, are cross-checked for both the constant crossover and the
blocked bridge. Strict positive-weight dominance is kept separate from zero
wins inside this finite box; absence of a box win is not a global impossibility.

Fresh public feature and main clones match all 45 source files and tracked
paths. There are 27 Python tests across 3.10-3.13 and nine Node/actual-Chrome
tests. Seventeen complete Python/JS weight reports compare 8,704 outcomes and
93 groups. Chrome checks 25 weight reports, all 4,096 outcome selections and
34,570 expression selections across eight controls and three widths, plus
current-weight export, invalid-selection recovery and stale clearing. Fresh
installed module and console reproduce eight controls each for all three
families outside the checkout and reject forgeries. Base and budget-barrier
checks remain intact. Feature/PR/main CI and Pages pass; all 13 live assets
match main and all 83 feature/main/live screenshots match without masks.

Costs count tree-node occurrences, not shared subexpressions or hardware
latency. This is an exhaustive integral weight box over a fixed seven-node
maximum grammar, not a continuous parameter-region analysis, learned policy,
e-graph, tensor engine, new algorithm or compiler-speed benchmark. The exact
rational identities are not IEEE floating-point transformation licenses.
Browser evidence is independently checked only after Python accepts its JSON.
## RewriteLab continuous regions: beyond a sampled cost grid

[Live explorer](https://midya8.github.io/rewritelab/regions.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab) · [Exact region contract](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab/blob/main/REGIONS.md) · [Merged change](https://github.com/midya8/rewritelab/pull/4)

A finite cost grid cannot prove that an expression never wins elsewhere.
This extension computes complete optimum regions over every strictly positive
addition, multiplication and leaf-cost ratio. Normalizing their sum to one
turns the parameter space into a triangle. Each group's exact halfplanes yield
reduced rational vertices, with full expression memberships and reachable
subsets retained. Semantic and reachable optima have separate regions.

Closed geometry is not a positive-cost verdict. Empty, point, segment and area
regions retain their dimensions. A boundary-only winner is not obtainable at
strictly positive costs; an interior tie point or segment can be a real winner
despite zero area. Shared edges and vertices belong to every tied group. Area
is not a probability. The zero-cost boundary closes the diagram, not the
optimizer's request domain.

The generator uses exact rational polygon clipping. A separate checker instead
constructs feasible supporting-line intersections, counts canonical syntax
symbols and validates the complete nested unit-cost closure. It reconstructs
every group, vertex, dimension and positive-feasibility flag without importing
the generator, clipping or recursive count traversal. Shared syntax and base
independent closure checking are disclosed. JavaScript uses BigInt rational
arithmetic; float coordinates are only a display layer over exact vertex text.

Fresh public feature and main source match all 54 files and tracked paths.
Thirty-five Python tests pass on each of 3.10-3.13, alongside eight Node engine
and four actual-Chrome tests. Seventeen Python/JavaScript region reports agree
on 93 groups and 215 vertices. Independent tests cover all 36 three-node
sources, 500 random vector sets, exact degenerate/interior/boundary cases,
all eight controls at all 512 old grid points, 64 outside-grid positive points,
and forged geometry, types, closure and membership. Installed module and console
reproduce eight controls each in all four families outside the checkout and
reject forgeries.

Chrome checks 25 region reports, all 4,096 point selections and 34,570 expression
selections across eight controls and three widths, complete rational vertex
text, both diagrams per group, export, invalid recovery, stale clearing and
outside-grid prices. All previous inspector, barrier and weight-box checks are
retained. Feature/PR/main CI and Pages pass. All 16 deployed assets match main;
all 111 feature/main/live screenshots match exactly without masks.

The continuous cost domain does not enlarge the expression grammar: fixed
3/5/7-node budgets, rational identities and complete ordered trees still apply.
Costs count tree occurrences, not shared subexpressions or hardware latency.
No new algorithm, e-graph, learned costs, tensor engine, compiler-speed benchmark
or IEEE floating-point transformation license is claimed. Enumeration remains
exponential. Browser evidence is independently checked only after the Python
region checker accepts its complete JSON.
## CPNetLab: a ranking is not an entailed preference

[Live workbench](https://midya8.github.io/cpnetlab/) · [Source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/cpnetlab) · [Contract and limits](https://github.com/midya8/cpnetlab/blob/main/CONTRACT.md) · [Prior-work ledger](https://github.com/midya8/cpnetlab/blob/main/SOURCES.md)

Complete, supplied binary CP-nets define legal single-variable improvements, not a universal score. CPNetLab enumerates every outcome and improving flip, finds shortest paths or closed no-path cuts, counts every compatible strict ranking, and supplies two actual opposite rankings when a pair is incomparable. Incomparable does not mean indifferent.

- **One legal flip can violate more rows.** In a four-variable fanout, `0000 → 1000` is an improving flip while violated rows rise from 1 to 3. All 2,304 compatible strict rankings still put the target above the start. Counting violated rows is not the preference semantics.
- **Dependency cycles and inconsistency are different.** A matching two-variable dependency cycle permits four strict rankings. Reversing one table produces the actual improving cycle `00 → 01 → 11 → 10 → 00`, zero strict rankings, and no vacuous dominance verdict.
- **Many rankings need not settle a pair.** Two independent consistent cycles admit exactly 101,977,088 rankings while leaving `0000` and `1111` incomparable. The UI displays a complete ranking for each direction.

A separate Python checker rebuilds the entire evidence report using Hamming-one pairs, Floyd-Warshall and suffix-removal counting, rather than the generator's conditional-row flips, breadth-first paths and prefix-ideal counting. Shared validation and binary encoding are disclosed. Python and JavaScript agree on all eight controls, 61 outcomes and 100 edges. Browser JSON is independently checked only after the Python verifier accepts it, not merely because export worked.

Reproduction covers all 36 two-variable networks and 576 ordered queries against all permutations; five three-variable fixtures against all 40,320 permutations each; 160 seeded additional networks; strict evidence forgeries; Python 3.10-3.13; and installed-wheel execution outside the checkout through module and console commands. Actual Chrome checks 24 reports at three widths, all 689 ordered control comparisons, every rendered conditional row, path, ranking witness and no-path cut, all eight evidence exports, and stale/invalid/cycle recovery. Final source, CI, deployment assets, behavior and pixels were checked before this showcase was published.

**Exact scope:** zero to four variables and at most 16 outcomes; complete strict binary local tables. No learned human preferences, local ties, missing rows, constraints, cardinal utility, partial-model semantics or scalable-solver claim. CP-net theory and graph/counting methods are established prior work; these are developed synthetic controls, not human-choice measurements or a new algorithm.


## CPNetLab row subsets: minimal is not minimum

[Live whole-row atlas](https://midya8.github.io/cpnetlab/scopes.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/cpnetlab) · [Contract](https://github.com/midya8/cpnetlab/blob/main/ROW-SUBSETS.md)

Enumerate every whole conditional-row subset, not one convenient explanation.
Eight developed controls cover 865 subset graphs with actual improving paths,
inconsistency cycles and compatible strict-ranking witnesses. The default
256-subset control has two minimal conflicts and six irreducible withdrawals:
three remove one row, three remove two. A separate control has two-row and four-row
minimal path supports. Minimal does not mean minimum; neither means the right
human preference to abandon.

The independent Python checker labels Hamming-one pairs, uses Floyd-Warshall
paths and checks all proper candidate subsets. It reconstructs every mask and
all four antichains without importing either analyzer. Shared strict input
validation/outcome encoding is disclosed. Browser JSON is independently checked
only after Python accepts it. Whole-row withdrawal removes all justified flips,
not an arbitrary single edge. All outcomes and the supplied model remain intact.
This is bounded what-if constraint evidence, not automatic preference revision,
indifference, extended partial-model semantics, learned preferences or a new
algorithm. At most eight rows, sixteen outcomes and 256 subsets.

Release checks: 14 Python tests on 3.10-3.13; six combined Node/actual-Chrome tests;
all 576 ordered two-variable query atlases (6,400 subset records); all 400
two-variable masks against every possible total order; 91 accepted seeded row
atlases; installed 0.2.0 wheel outside the checkout through both CLI entry points
for both eight-control families; forged-evidence rejection. Actual deployed Chrome
selects all 865 masks, all 46 antichain buttons, every row toggle and all eight
exports, with stale/invalid/row-limit recovery and eight controls at three widths.
The original complete-model checks remain green. Feature/PR/main CI and Pages
passed; 37 source files, all 11 live assets and the root page match, with 28
main/feature and 28 main/deployed unmasked pixel matches.


## EpistemLab: true when said, false after heard

[Live workbench](https://midya8.github.io/epistemlab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/epistemlab) · [Evidence contract](https://github.com/midya8/epistemlab/blob/main/CONTRACT.md) · [Prior work](https://github.com/midya8/epistemlab/blob/main/SOURCES.md)

A public announcement can be truthful and make its own content false. EpistemLab
shows every world removed, every surviving information block, and the newly
evaluated truth set of every subformula. In the default two-world experiment,
"p, but agent a does not know p" retains one world and becomes false there.
The fact remains true; the ignorance does not.

Eight developed controls also separate everybody's knowledge from common
knowledge with an actual two-agent failure chain; show distributed knowledge
that neither agent has alone; inspect disconnected common-knowledge components;
and follow three observers through an 8 → 7 → 4 → 1 world sequence. Repeated
updates and eliminated focus worlds are explicit. Empty is not false: pointed
query values are null when the focus no longer exists.

The Python generator uses recursive pointwise semantics and breadth-first paths.
A separate verifier rebuilds the complete report with truth-set algebra,
descending fixed points, block intersections and Floyd-Warshall distances.
Shared strict input validation is disclosed. JavaScript reproduces the complete
control reports; browser exports count as independently checked only after the
Python verifier accepts them. Every modal obligation includes all reachable
worlds, canonical shortest paths and an actual shortest failure witness when one
exists. No model, backend, or paid API is called.

Release checks: seven Python tests on 3.10-3.13, four Node/actual-Chrome tests,
all 200 three-world/two-agent partition-and-valuation models, 120 seeded nested
requests, strict malformed/forged-evidence rejection, and an installed 0.1.0
wheel outside the checkout through both module and console entry points. Actual
Chrome checks 24 responsive reports, 51 round snapshots, 383 formula/world
selections, 142 modal obligations, eight exports and stale/invalid/empty recovery.
Feature, PR, main CI and Pages passed. All 27 source files and seven deployed
assets plus the root page match; 30 feature/main and 30 main/live screenshots
match without masks. Final deployed desktop, phone and edge-state pixels were
inspected before publication.

**Exact scope:** finite supplied S5 models, at most 16 worlds, five atoms, three
agents, six queries and four sequential global truthful restrictions. No beliefs,
probabilities, language-to-knowledge inference, real-person knowledge claims,
arbitrary public-announcement quantification, or new-algorithm claim. Truth loss
is evidence for this supplied model and update, not a proof that a formula fails
in every model. Sources distinguish these model-specific checks from general
announcement-validity questions.


## EpistemLab disclosures: a restriction is not an announcement

[Live disclosure atlas](https://midya8.github.io/epistemlab/disclosures.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/epistemlab) · [Exact contract](https://github.com/midya8/epistemlab/blob/main/DISCLOSURES.md)

Enumerate every retained-world subset, but count only actual Boolean-definable
announcements over the supplied atoms as solutions. An arbitrary what-if
restriction can split worlds with identical atomic facts. No Boolean formula
over those atoms can do that. The atlas supplies a retained/removed pair with the
same valuation as an explicit obstruction, or complete defining DNF cubes when
the restriction is expressible.

Eight developed controls cover 324 restrictions and 25 separate knowledge goals.
The default goal has two inclusion-maximal successful disclosures retaining two
and three worlds; only the latter is maximum-retained. Another control has two
successful diagnostic restrictions and no Boolean solution. A stronger truthful
Boolean disclosure can also destroy an ignorance goal. The search checks all
proper supersets, not just one-bit neighbours: a direct regression has successful
masks 1 and 7 with failing intermediate masks 3 and 5.

A separate Python checker enumerates world combinations and unions of valuation
classes, then uses independent truth-set/fixed-point/Floyd semantics for every
restriction. It rebuilds every defining cube, obstruction, post-update query
truth set, frontier and stronger-disclosure loss witness without importing the
atlas generator. Shared strict model parsing is disclosed. Browser exports count
as independently checked only after the Python verifier accepts them. The UI also
shows the complete restricted model and actual modal obligation paths. A removed
focus has null pointed answers; inspecting another surviving world never turns
it into an answer about the eliminated focus.

Release checks: 14 Python tests on 3.10-3.13; nine Node/actual-Chrome tests; all
200 small-model atlases/1,600 restriction records against every one-atom Boolean
truth function; 45 nested-goal atlases; malformed and forged-evidence rejection;
and installed 0.2.0 wheel reproduction outside the checkout through both CLI
entry points for both eight-control families. Deployed atlas Chrome checks 24
responsive reports, 972 mask selections, 75 goal selections, 204 frontier/witness
buttons, 2,596 subformula selections including 1,170 modal obligations, 87 world
toggles, eight exports and stale/invalid/prior-anchor/empty recovery. Original
sequential-update checks remain green. Feature/PR/main CI and Pages passed; all
39 source files and 12 deployed assets plus root match, with 60 feature/main and
60 main/live unmasked screenshot matches across both surfaces. Actual desktop,
phone, obstruction, goal-loss and empty-state pixels were inspected.

**Exact scope:** at most eight supplied worlds, five fixed atoms, three S5 agents,
six separately evaluated goals, no prior announcements, and one Boolean
restriction. No fresh atoms, epistemic-announcement search, speaker-knowledge
requirement, arbitrary-announcement logic, general planning, shortest-formula
claim or privacy guarantee. Counting retained worlds is a finite combinatorial
objective, not probability or real information leakage. These are established
semantic and truth-table methods with explicit finite evidence, not a new
algorithm or a claim about real people's knowledge.


## StableLab: support is not grounding

[Live workbench](https://midya8.github.io/stablelab/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab) · [Exact contract](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab/blob/main/CONTRACT.md) · [Prior-work ledger](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab/blob/main/SOURCES.md)

A model can be supported and minimal, yet still not stable. StableLab makes the
missing foundation visible. Enumerate every candidate interpretation of a tiny
normal logic program, inspect the actual Gelfond-Lifschitz reduct, and follow
its synchronous derivation rounds from the empty set. See every original rule's
truth test, every support, every proper-subset classical model and every
nonempty unfounded subset with all rule-level obligations.

The program `p <- not p; p <- q; q <- p` has exactly one classical model,
`{p,q}`. It is both supported and minimal. But its candidate reduct contains
only a positive cycle and derives nothing, so there is no stable model. Other
controls separate even and odd default cycles, constraint filtering, a fact
that grounds four derivation layers, exceptions to defaults, one empty stable
model versus no model, and 16 stable alternatives among 256 candidates. Ten
developed synthetic controls contain 300 candidates in total. When no stable
model exists, brave and skeptical answers are explicitly null here, rather than
presenting vacuous universal truth as evidence.

The separate Python checker does not call the generator. It enumerates every
reduct model and proper candidate subset to test stability, intersects models of
the definite reduct for its least closure, reconstructs rounds by bounded proof
heights, and independently checks every unfounded subset. Shared strict input
validation is disclosed. Browser exports become independently checked only
when `stablelab verify evidence.json` accepts them.

Release evidence: nine Python tests on 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13; four Node/actual-Chrome
tests; all 1,177 two-atom programs through two signed-body rules/constraints;
200 seeded three-atom programs; forged-evidence rejection; and installed 0.1.0
wheel reproduction outside the checkout through both CLI entry points on all
ten controls. An optional external clingo 5.8.3 comparison agreed on stable-model
families for 1,387 programs. That finite check does not validate the UI/proof
evidence or prove general solver compatibility.

Actual deployed Chrome checks 30 responsive reports, all 900 candidate selections,
6,537 unfounded subset selections and 16,605 rule obligations, 1,926 closure
rounds, every displayed rule/reduct/support/query verdict, ten exports accepted
by Python, stale/invalid input and recovery. All 27 native/fresh feature/main
source files match, as do six deployed assets plus root. All 31 feature/main and
31 main/live unmasked screenshot pairs match. Desktop and phone pixels, circular
support, stable alternatives, seeded closure, empty/no-model cases and error
states were inspected. Feature/PR/main CI and Pages are green; PR1 merged
normally after all final checks passed.

**Exact scope:** at most eight declared propositional atoms and 32 normal rules
or headless constraints. Facts and default negation, not a full ASP language.
No variables or variable grounding, function symbols, classical negation,
disjunction, choice rules, aggregates, optimization, well-founded semantics or
clingo text compatibility. Established finite enumeration and semantic methods,
not a new algorithm or a scalable solver. Synthetic programs, not real agents'
beliefs. Model counts are not probabilities.

## StableLab: safe replacement, not matching answers

Equal stable models today does not make a rule module safe to swap. StableLab 0.2.0 now checks every SE pair and produces an actual rule context when two finite modules differ, including controls with equal classical **and** stable families but unequal SE sets.

[Live safe-replacement inspector](https://midya8.github.io/stablelab/equivalence.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab) · [Contract and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab/blob/main/EQUIVALENCE.md) · [Merged PR #2](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab/pull/2)

- Complete `X ⊆ Y` atlas: up to five atoms, 243 pairs, 24 normal rules per side. Every original/reduct obligation is visible; every difference supplies a concrete facts/cycle context with both augmented stable families and full candidate evidence.
- Independent three-valued Python reconstruction and proper-subset context model checks, not another call to the generator. Shared strict parsers and the base evidence verifier are disclosed. Eleven controls include an actual two-edge positive cycle gadget, safe transitive-edge removal, redundant rules, contextual inconsistency and empty vocabulary.
- Reproduced from final feature and main: 16 Python tests on 3.10–3.13; eight Node/Chrome tests; installed 0.2.0 wheel, both CLI entry points, all 11 comparison controls and forged-verdict rejection. Optional clingo 5.8.3 agrees on 5,184 base and 3,514 augmented families across 2,592 comparisons.
- Actual deployed Chrome checks 33 comparison reports at desktop/390/320 widths, all 993 displayed pairs and 9,012 rule obligations, 24 context displays and 11 downloaded reports independently verified in Python. Final feature/main and main/live each match on 65 unmasked screenshots across the base and comparison inspectors. All 11 deployed assets plus root match final main exactly. Feature/PR/main CI and Pages are green.

The strong-equivalence claim is restricted to finite normal-rule contexts over the same declared vocabulary. No arbitrary ASP syntax, fresh-atom context UI, update-semantics preservation, scalable-solver or new-theory claim. Published SE-model foundations and the cycle specialization are credited in [SOURCES.md](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab/blob/main/SOURCES.md). The original eight-atom reduct inspector remains available.


## StableLab: every input, not every rule

A rule module can agree under every added set of facts and still fail under a new rule. StableLab 0.3.0 makes that distinction inspectable: ordinary, uniform and strong equivalence are separate promises, not interchangeable labels.

[Live fact-input inspector](https://midya8.github.io/stablelab/uniform.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab) · [Contract and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab/blob/main/UNIFORM.md) · [Feature PR #3](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab/pull/3) · [Download-readiness regression #4](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab/pull/4)

- Every positive fact subset over the declared vocabulary, with both augmented stable families and every candidate's original rules, reduct and closure. The smallest separator is minimum-cardinality only after **all** smaller inputs agree; equal-size ties use the lowest bitmask. Ten controls reach minimum fact counts 0/1/2/3/4, empty vocabulary and the complete 32-input table.
- The complete UE-pair atlas retains diagonal and maximal proper SE pairs, exposes every disqualifying proper extension and checks that UE equality agrees with the full input table. The credited Eiter/Fink Example 2 agrees under all eight fact inputs but fails under the displayed rule context.
- A separate Python checker reconstructs context candidates through definite-model intersections and proper-subset reduct tests without calling either generator. Shared parsers, checked comparison evidence and the base verifier are disclosed. The JavaScript engine is a portable generator, not another independent solver.
- Final feature/main reproduction: 22 Python tests on 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13; eleven Node/actual-Chrome tests; installed 0.3.0 wheel outside the checkout, both CLI entry points, all 10 base/11 comparison/10 uniform controls and forged-report rejection. Optional clingo 5.8.3 agrees on 20,978 augmented stable families across 10,489 fact contexts and 2,511 comparisons. This finite check is not a general solver proof.
- Actual deployed Chrome checks 30 uniform reports at desktop/390/320 widths, every one of 255 fact selections, 4,539 candidate selections, 41,343 displayed rule obligations and 1,290 UE-pair selections, plus ten exports accepted by Python. Both earlier inspectors also pass. All 56 native/fresh source files and 16 deployed assets plus root match; 96 feature/main and 96 main/live unmasked screenshots match exactly. Main CI and Pages are green. Desktop/phone overview, fact/candidate details and UE/contract pixels were inspected.

A main-only CI failure exposed a test-harness race: a download path could exist before its bytes finished writing. The preserved failure led to a delayed/partial-write regression and transport-readiness checks across all three inspectors. Parsing, full evidence equality and independent verification still run once; semantic failures are not retried.

**Exact scope:** at most five declared propositional atoms and 24 normal rules per side, including constraints. Added inputs are positive facts over that same vocabulary. Established finite semantics, not new theory, an update-semantics guarantee or a scalable solver. No disjunction, variables, aggregates, classical negation, fresh-atom context UI or broader ASP syntax. [Published foundations and credit](https://github.com/midya8/stablelab/blob/main/SOURCES.md). The original reduct and strong-equivalence inspectors remain available.


## HornLab: deletion has a derivation debt

Removing a fact can leave a cycle with positive local support and no finite derivation. HornLab 0.3.0 now maintains explicit fact transactions with a complete delete/rederive trace, then shows exactly where a deliberately weaker local-support pruning check goes wrong.

[Live fact-maintenance inspector](https://midya8.github.io/hornlab/updates.html) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/hornlab) · [Exact contract and credited foundations](https://github.com/midya8/hornlab/blob/main/UPDATES.md) · [Merged PR #3](https://github.com/midya8/hornlab/pull/3)

- Conservative overdeletion, surviving one-step derivations and restored/new delta insertion, with every transaction, round, indexed rule obligation and lost/gained/restored atom. Explicit facts can also be inferred; deleting their explicit status does not necessarily delete their consequence. Twelve developed controls include alternate routes, conjunction, cycles, empty-body rules, duplicates, mixed updates, no-ops and empty vocabulary.
- A separate set-based checker reconstructs the full trace and checks each resulting least model by intersecting all definite-Horn models, without calling the generator. Shared strict validation is disclosed. Python/JavaScript parity covers 212 complete requests and 1,627 transactions; it is not substituted for the independent checker.
- Final feature/main reproduction passes 26 Python tests on 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13 and eight Node/Chrome tests. Exhaustive tests cover all 4,096 two-atom program/old-fact/new-fact transitions plus 350 seeded eight-step sequences, full-field/type forgeries and atomic CLI failures. Installed 0.3.0 wheel checks run outside the checkout through both entry points for 10 base, 11 rule-audit and 12 update controls, including rejection of forged updates.
- Optional clingo 5.8.3 agrees on 11,381 positive-program stable families across 4,458 requests and 6,923 transactions. Actual deployed Chrome checks 36 new reports at 1280/390/320, 81 transaction selections, 546 phase/round records, 1,491 displayed obligations and twelve downloaded exports independently accepted by Python. Both earlier inspectors also pass their full checks.
- All 49 native/fresh feature/main source files and fourteen deployed assets plus root match exactly. Feature/PR/main CI and Pages are green. All 43 update-inspector plus twelve targeted earlier-inspector screenshots match unmasked in both feature/main and main/live comparisons. Phone overview, narrow-phone cyclic retention, desktop rederivation and both earlier inspectors' new links were visually inspected.

The local contrast counts explicit membership plus currently firing indexed rules, not finite proof trees. It starts each transaction from the same correct old closure and is explicitly **not** the published Counting algorithm, DRedC or modern recursive counting methods. The positive, single-stratum delete/rederive specialization is credited to published work and does not claim its optimized no-repeated-inference bounds. Six atoms, eight fixed positive rules, at most eight fact transactions. No negation, relation tuples, variables, rule updates, full Datalog, new theory or production performance claim. The original inference and rule-deletion inspectors remain available.


### ConceptLab: a table is not an expert

[Live exact-expert exploration](https://midya8.github.io/conceptlab/exploration.html) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/conceptlab) | [Protocol and inspected foundations](https://github.com/midya8/conceptlab/blob/main/EXPLORATION.md) | [Merged PR #3](https://github.com/midya8/conceptlab/pull/3)

An implication can fit every observed row and still fail in the supplied domain. This finite attribute-exploration simulator asks the strongest observed implication for a premise, retains every expert-table counterexample, reveals the lowest-ID refutation and retries the same premise. Accepted implications change the next lectic pivot; every seed, earlier-coordinate disagreement and derivation round remains inspectable. The expert is an explicitly supplied complete table, not a human or language model. Vacuous validity is not evidence about the world.

- A separate set-based Python checker reconstructs theory closure by intersecting all satisfying models, checks each pivot against exhaustive lectic successors, and checks the canonical basis through an independent recursive pseudo-intent characterization. It does not call either generator. The final audit compares accepted-knowledge, full-expert and final-observed closures for every attribute subset, with support IDs and all missing-attribute counterexamples. Some rows can remain unseen without losing the supplied table's implication theory.
- Fresh feature/main reproduction passes 24 native tests on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13 and all eleven Node/Chrome tests. All 6,654 small expert-family/initial-observation combinations are checked; Python and JavaScript agree across 6,966 reports and 64,658 events. The installed 0.3.0 wheel runs both entry points outside the checkout for fourteen complete-context, twelve partial-context and twelve exploration controls, with forged-export rejection.
- Optional concepts 0.9.2 agrees on 175,003 support/closure checks. It does not validate scheduling; 88 empty-axis requests are excluded from that package comparison and remain tested internally. Actual deployed Chrome checks 36 exploration reports at 1280/390/320, 273 events, 204 pivots, 294 premise obligations, 702 displayed derivation rounds and twelve downloaded exports accepted by the independent Python CLI. Both earlier inspectors pass their full behavior checks.
- All fifty native/fresh feature/main files and fourteen deployed assets plus root match exactly. Feature/PR/main CI and Pages are green. Forty new-inspector plus 21 targeted original-inspector/accepted-pivot screenshots match unmasked in feature/main and main/live comparisons. Phone rejection, narrow-phone lectic evidence, desktop accepted implication and both prior inspectors' new links were visually inspected.

Five attributes, eight supplied objects. Twelve original synthetic controls include repeated rejection, implication chains, empty contexts, unsupported premises, duplicate row identities and sufficient-but-not-exhaustive observations. Published FCA, NextClosure and attribute-exploration theory are credited; no new algorithm, minimum-question claim, live human expert, background theory, partial/noisy expert, statistical generalization or production scalability claim. Previous complete and partial inspectors are preserved.

## ArgumentLab: a cycle can split after a choice

[Live SCC inspector](https://midya8.github.io/argumentlab/scc.html) · [Source and exact method](https://github.com/midya8/argumentlab/blob/main/SCC.md) · [Verified PR3](https://github.com/midya8/argumentlab/pull/3)

Version0.3 makes established SCC-recursive CF2/stage2 semantics inspectable, beside the original defense and attack-switch inspectors. Every reached induced graph retains every candidate, external component-defeat edge, restricted child and recursive membership obligation. The child drill preserves selected arguments; SCCs are recomputed after deletion. The default cascade splits one component into several and then deletes again. A six-cycle separates maximal conflict-free sets from maximal ranges; global stage and stage2 are kept distinct.

Independent set/reachability reconstruction checks every evidence record and a second published fixed-point characterization. The original hash-pinned ASPARTIX encodings under clingo5.8.3 agree on725 frameworks and1,450 extension families. Python/JavaScript full reports agree on725 frameworks,3,052 induced subproblems,16,375 candidates and38,184 obligations. All39 Python functions pass on3.10-3.13,15 Node/Chrome tests pass, and the installed wheel checks19 defense,21 switch and14 SCC controls outside the checkout, seven module origins and14 rejected forged reports.

Fresh public feature/main source is exact; feature/PR/main CI and Pages are green. All15 deployed assets plus root match main. Actual deployed Chrome checks42 SCC reports at320/390/1280,171 subproblems,1,056 candidate selections,1,128 obligations and14 real independently verified downloads. All52 SCC screenshots match feature/main/live without masks. Old defense/switch behavior and navigation remain checked. Six arguments, exhaustive enumeration, supplied attacks as assumptions. No new theorem, scalable solver, human persuasion result or universal ranking of semantics. Published foundations and external code are credited.


## BisimLab: silence can hide a choice

[Live silent-action inspector](https://midya8.github.io/bisimlab/silent.html) · [Source and exact contract](https://github.com/midya8/bisimlab/blob/main/SILENT.md) · [Reviewed change](https://github.com/midya8/bisimlab/pull/3)

Explicit hiding exposes three different answers: strong, branching and weak bisimilarity. This bounded inspector records every fixed-point round, removed pair, attack and canonical finite response skeleton, including the before-step requirement that weak matching can lose. Silent reachability and possible-divergence cycle witnesses are separate: no rooted or divergence-preserving semantics, fairness, liveness or deployed-agent guarantee is claimed. The default contrast reconstructs Bisping Example6.3 and is credited, not claimed as new.

Independent BFS generation, DFS/set replay and candidate-relation test oracles; full native/JS agreement on1,154 reports with8,461 rounds,4,014 removed pairs and8,166 response records. Optional unmodified mCRL2 ltscompare202507.0 agrees on350 systems/5,652 comparisons. All23 native tests pass on3.10-3.13, all9 Node/Chrome tests pass, and an installed wheel reproduces6 base/7 trace/10 silent controls outside the checkout through four entrypoints, checks eight module origins and rejects20 forged reports. Actual Chrome checks30 silent reports at320/390/1280,294 rounds,498 removed-pair selections,960 attacks,414 response records and10 independently verified downloads, plus18-loop graph geometry. These are bounded coverage counts, not a proof or speed benchmark.

## CausalLab: a mediator can identify an effect

CausalLab now checks the established sufficient frontdoor criterion, keeping all three conditions visible even when several fail. Directed bypass witnesses and two full ancestral-moral certificates explain the result. A caller-declared candidate search distinguishes all passing, inclusion-minimal and minimum-size sets. A separate exact-rational functional retains every conditional, weight and contribution from a supplied positive joint. [Source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/causallab), [contract and credited sources](https://github.com/midya8/causallab/blob/main/FRONTDOOR.md), [reviewed change](https://github.com/midya8/causallab/pull/1).

All 164 tests pass on Python 3.10-3.13, including independent original-DAG path oracles on 3,792 cases, 81 prescribed SCM parameter settings checked against separate exact intervention-world sums, nonbinary and joint-mediator controls, and the full 4,096-cell boundary. An optional external ciflypy 0.1.3 check agrees on another 3,792 fixed-set comparisons. Fresh installed wheels on all four Python versions verify 11 module origins and reproduce seven complete reports through two entrypoints plus two exact functional queries. Feature/PR and main CI are green; all 57 native files match fresh public checkouts. The sixth fixed figure has byte-identical regeneration and unmasked feature/main/live pixels; the original five figures are unchanged.

The credited latent-confounding motif and an original fixed synthetic XOR fixture separate observed conditionals 41/112 and 37/80 from the frontdoor functional 7/16 and 9/16. The caller supplies the causal graph, latent assumptions, measurable candidates and exact joint; the joint does not validate those assumptions. Strictly positive treatment/mediator support is required, never an invented zero for an undefined conditional. Bounded coverage is not a proof, statistical estimate, medical recommendation, scalable solver, graph discovery, general identification or a new causal theorem.

## ShieldLab: safe waiting is not arrival

ShieldLab now separates safe waiting from forced arrival. A finite reach-before-unsafe inspector exposes every synchronous attractor obligation, exact minimum worst-case first-goal bound and complete ranked strategy or target-avoiding counterstrategy. Every original move and every positional controller assignment remains inspectable: a winning successor can still stall, while a slower fixed policy can still win. [Live first-goal inspector](https://midya8.github.io/shieldlab/reachavoid.html), [source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/shieldlab), [contract and eight-source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/shieldlab/blob/main/REACHAVOID.md), [reviewed change](https://github.com/midya8/shieldlab/pull/2).

All 24 native tests pass on Python 3.10-3.13, preserving all 8 original tests. Independent deterministic strategy-pair simulation checks 324 two-state and 32,928 three-state cases; 120 seeded larger cases and the 729-policy boundary have full replay. All six Node/Chrome tests pass, including 457 complete native/JavaScript reports, 1,329 policies and 6,291 root outcomes. Actual Chrome drills every policy/root across 12 controls at 320/390/1280 and verifies 12 event-confirmed downloaded reports through the native CLI. Fresh installed wheels on each Python version reproduce 6 original and 12 new reports through two entrypoints, check 8 module origins and reject 20 forged CLI records. Feature/PR, main and Pages checks are green; all 38 native files match fresh public source and deployed assets/behavior/pixels are verified.

Terminal safe goals stop the play on first hit; empty targets lose and unsafe roots fail immediately. No fairness assumption forces the environment to cooperate. Safety-until-goal treats success as absorbing and is not necessarily the original nonterminal infinite-safety objective. Complete assignments include unreachable active controller decisions but exclude irrelevant goal/unsafe actions. The original safety engine, checker, controls and tests keep their semantics. Established finite-game theory and original bounded controls are credited, not presented as a new theorem, external-solver benchmark, scalable solver, learned runtime shield, probabilistic guarantee or proof about real software.

## AbsorbLab: success changes the path

AbsorbLab separates eventual success from the paths selected by success. A finite Markov first-hit inspector exposes exact success, failure and never-terminal probabilities; conditional timing moments; closed-cycle support evidence; every Doob-conditioned transition; and replayable finite-horizon mass. In the default original control, equal direct/risky branches become 4/5 direct and 1/5 risky given eventual success, while mean time given success is 6/5 and unconditional time to stopped success is infinite. Local failure-edge removal cannot explain that global selection. [Live conditioning inspector](https://midya8.github.io/absorblab/), [source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/absorblab), [derivation and eight-source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/absorblab/blob/main/METHOD.md), [reviewed change](https://github.com/midya8/absorblab/pull/1).

All 16 native tests pass on Python 3.10-3.13, including 9,261 three-state uniform-support/status cases, 729 deterministic cases, 81 two-state cases, 120 seeded chains and 120 separate acyclic path-moment checks. An independent checker uses simple paths, permutation determinants/cofactors and stopped-chain powers rather than the generator's support rounds, elimination and active-flow propagation. Four Node/Chrome tests include 213 complete native/BigInt reports, 4,284 forecast rows and 191 elimination stages. Actual Chrome checks 36 control/width reports and verifies twelve event-confirmed downloaded certificates natively. Fresh installed wheels on every Python version check six module origins, twelve reports through two entrypoints and twenty forged CLI rejections. A genuine optional SymPy 1.14.0 reference checks 682 probability pairs and 351 conditional moment triplets over 213 inputs. All 28 native files match fresh public checkouts; feature/PR, main and Pages checks are green, with deployed assets, controls, downloads and all 53 unmasked full-screen pixel comparisons verified.

Supplied probabilities are not learned, calibrated or adversarial choices. First success or failure stops the run, including time-zero terminal roots; closed nonterminal classes can prevent either hit forever. Zero-success conditional rows and times remain undefined, not invented zeros. The restricted finite-state inverse is justified by support reachability before algebra; finite horizon does not truncate eventual quantities. SymPy and cross-implementation agreement are bounded example evidence, not universal proof or performance benchmarks. Classical finite Markov and Doob-transform sources are credited; this is an original bounded implementation, checker and controls, not new probability theory, a scalable solver, causal intervention, policy optimization or a guarantee about real AI agents.

## BranchLab: always possible is not inevitable

[Live workbench](https://midya8.github.io/branchlab/) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/branchlab) | [Method and proof limits](https://github.com/midya8/branchlab/blob/main/METHOD.md) | [Implementation PR](https://github.com/midya8/branchlab/pull/1)

An explicit finite CTL inspector for branching-time reasoning about supplied models. In the default, AG EF p holds while AF p fails: a goal remains reachable everywhere, but an infinite wait is still allowed. Twelve original controls separate nested path quantifiers, different existential witnesses, strong-until failure, time-zero success and finite versus lasso counterexamples. No fairness assumption silently removes an inconvenient branch.

Python and browser JavaScript expose every unique subformula's truth set, synchronous least/greatest rounds, all-state obligations and the complete 2^n subset-image atlas. A separate native checker derives truth by enumerating all fixed points, reconstructs every typed certificate field and independently enumerates finite prefixes and first-repeat lassos. Single traces are shown only when they are valid evidence for the selected existential truth or universal failure; other claims explicitly require branching certificates.

Reproduced from complete published source:15 native tests on Python3.10/11/12/13 and four outside-checkout installed-wheel checks; all144 two-state graph/labelling cases and a direct path/lasso oracle on2744 three-state cases; genuine pyModelChecking1.3.4 agreement on212 requests and3630 subformula truth sets. Complete browser/native records agree on276 requests; actual Chrome checks36 control/width reports,192 subformulas,558 state selections,237 rounds,1110 subset rows and12 completed exports replayed natively. Classical bounded CTL, not symbolic scale, LTL/CTL*, verified AI agents or new theory. Runtime needs no paid API or external package; the optional GPL test reference is not vendored.

## ProvLab: one fact is not two chances

A finite relational-provenance workbench for symbolic data reasoning. Shared query variables perform real joins; projection and union-all collect derivations into natural-coefficient polynomials. The default `p² + pq` has bag multiplicity `10`, exact answer-presence probability `1/2`, and an intentionally invalid ordinary probability substitution of `3/8`. Reusing a token is one event, not a fresh independent draw.

Inspect fourteen controls, partial join bindings, every derivation, all witness sets, minimal Boolean witnesses and every possible-world mass. The separate native checker enumerates active-domain valuations and re-queries possible databases; SQLite token-carrying joins feed actual SymPy polynomial checks. Complete native/browser parity, installed-wheel replay, actual Chrome controls at1280/390/320px and trusted certificate downloads are checked independently. Core inference is dependency-free and uses exact rational arithmetic.

Classical provenance semirings and tuple-independent base-event semantics, not new theory, arbitrary SQL, scalable database inference, calibrated probabilities, causal effects or a guarantee about an AI agent. Feature/PR/main CI, Pages deployment, exact deployed assets and live behavior/pixels were verified before this showcase was added.

## ProvLab0.2: same answers on every database

ProvLab now compares safe positive conjunctive queries over every finite database under set semantics. A head-preserving reverse homomorphism proves containment; a failed direction produces a concrete frozen canonical database and a missing output tuple. Inspect every variable-map candidate, its atom images and ordered head constraints, both canonical evaluations, and every safe atom-subset minimum. Constants stay fixed, Boolean heads and ternary relations are explicit, and repeated atom occurrences remain visible.

Set-equivalent is not bag-equivalent. The default repeated-fact rewrite preserves the answer set but changes a multiplicity2 probe from4 to2 and natural provenance from f0^2 to f0. The extension has a separate native generator and active-domain replay checker, strict JSON editing, readable desktop/mobile evidence, and genuinely downloadable reports. Thirty-two Python tests include235 single-field corruption rejections and80 direct finite-instance checks;112 cross-language comparisons cover17,403 candidate maps and1,662 subset rows. Actual SQLite DISTINCT/ALL/token joins ran1,344 queries, and SymPy checked362 polynomials built from those token rows. These are finite reference checks, not a scalability benchmark or proof of the classical theorem.

The exact public source, clean installed-wheel reproduction, four hosted Python versions, Chrome controls and trusted report downloads, deployed assets/behavior/pixels, and both bidirectional set decisions were checked before this note was finalized. The lab implements classical Chandra-Merlin query-containment/core theory, with primary and academic sources credited. It is bounded single-CQ syntax, not new theory, a bag-equivalence decision procedure, arbitrary SQL optimization, a language model, or a verified-AI-agent guarantee. The earlier data-provenance lab remains available.

## ProvLab0.3: the assumptions change the answer

A finite full-rule/key chase makes constraint-aware query rewrites inspectable. Full rules add facts; keys merge query symbols in both the database and the ordered output tuple. The workbench shows both containment directions, every chase step, terminal dependency checks, source derivations and legal saturated counterexamples. A clash between distinct literals is labeled as target-query unsatisfiability and vacuous containment, not a successful nonempty rewrite.

Every dependency subset is tested. The default needs a key plus a diagonal rule; neither alone suffices, and a symmetry rule is irrelevant. Another control separates a one-rule minimum support from a two-rule inclusion-minimal support. Validation includes44 Python tests,114 complete native/JavaScript reports, an independent ground replay,344 primitive evidence mutations rejected, actual SQLite dependency/query checks and installed-wheel reproduction. Actual Chrome checks14 controls at1280/390/320px, both directions,171 trace states,141 subset selections and14 trusted certificate downloads replayed by Python.

This is bounded classical database theory with full single-head rules and relational keys, not existential chasing, arbitrary EGDs, SQL NULL, bag-preserving optimization or global query minimization. The original provenance and unconstrained-containment labs remain available. The deployed demo and exact source were verified after the normal merge and hosted checks.

## ArgumentLab0.4: everyone includes it. Who defends it?

A skeptical intersection is not automatically a defensible shared position. The ideal/eager inspector retains every original attacker, including those outside the intersection, and removes undefended members simultaneously until a fixed point. An original eight-argument control exposes a two-round cascade: {a3,a4,a7} becomes {a3,a7}, then {a7}. One-pass pruning and deleting outside attackers both give the wrong answer.

Native bitsets, an independent complete-ternary-labelling/set checker and JavaScript sets agree on645 full reports: all531 directed graphs on0..3 arguments,100 seeded4..8 graphs and14 original controls. Actual PyArg2.0.2 matches1,290 ideal/eager families. The release has53 Python tests,18 Node tests, isolated installed-wheel replay,377 rejected primitive-leaf mutations and20 selected forged CLI rejections with atomic output preservation. Live Chrome checks42 reports,84 core views,117 trace states,4,266 candidate selections and14 trusted completed downloads independently replayed at1280/390/320 widths. All61 full unmasked live/local/feature/main screenshots match exactly;21 deployed assets and the root alias equal main.

Explore parent positions, original-graph defense responses, every simultaneous pruning round, every candidate subset and each argument's removal reason. Established finite ideal/eager semantics for0..8 supplied arguments, not truth scoring, persuasion, a scalable solver or arbitrary infinite-framework eager uniqueness. Exact-feature/PR/main CI and Pages passed; earlier core, attack-switch and SCC workflows remain intact.

## AbsorbLab0.2: same now, different next

AbsorbLab0.2 asks when two states may really become one. The exact labeled strong-lumpability inspector refines original Markov transition rows by their mass into every current block, exposes every same-block obligation and split witness, and compares the complete set-partition atlas including noncontiguous blocks and both extremes. In the original six-state control, equal immediate goal mass hides a second-round split: s0 and s1 separate after their successors do, while noncontiguous s0 and s5 remain merged. Every representative of a final block agrees, so the quotient needs no averaging. [Live aggregation inspector](https://midya8.github.io/absorblab/lumping.html), [source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/absorblab), [derivation and inspected sources](https://github.com/midya8/absorblab/blob/main/LUMPING.md), [reviewed change](https://github.com/midya8/absorblab/pull/2).

All 30 Python tests and seven Node tests pass, retaining the original first-hit workflows. The new native, independent all-partition checker and BigInt browser agree on 527 full reports, 6,448 partition records, 637 refinement states and 4,038 quotient obligations; 255 separately changed noninput primitive leaves are rejected. A genuinely invoked optional SymPy 1.14.0 reference checks all 527 requests, every partition mass matrix and 2,038 matrix-power identities. Actual Chrome exercises 36 lumping reports at 1280/390/320 pixels, 48 refinement states, 138 pair selections, 816 partition selections, 618 forecast selections, 345 graph edges and twelve trusted completed downloads replayed natively. Fresh installed wheels confirm ten module origins, twelve new controls through both entrypoints and 24 forged CLI rejections with atomic output preservation, retaining prior first-hit installation checks. All 45 exact public files, feature/PR and main CI, Pages, deployed assets, behavior and 46 unmasked full-screen comparisons were verified.

Observation tags and success/failure/nonterminal status are part of the contract. Strong lumpability uses the raw transition matrix, including terminal outgoing edges, rather than silently substituting first-hit stopped rows. The certificate checks PC=CQ cell by cell; the resulting all-power identity follows by induction for any initial distribution, not by extrapolating finite forecast agreement. First-hit probabilities, conditional moments and infinite or undefined values are compared separately. These are supplied finite chains of at most six states and established strong/ordinary lumpability with exact rational arithmetic, not weak or approximate aggregation, reward preservation, new theory, a full PCTL checker, a scalable solver or a guarantee about real AI workflows. The independent engines share the written specification and schema; the optional matrix reference is bounded implementation evidence, not a theorem prover.


## BranchLab0.2: a fair path must meet them all

BranchLab0.2 asks which infinite paths an assumption really leaves. The separate state-justice fair-CTL inspector compares ordinary and fair truth at every subformula, exposes every induced region and its recurrent components, and shows all justice hits, backward rounds and a replayable finite-prefix/closed-walk witness. Its original four-state hub needs the repeated walk s0 → s1 → s0 → s2 → s0 to meet both justice constraints; neither first simple cycle is enough. A trap can still satisfy a local atom while having no fair infinite continuation. [Live fairness inspector](https://midya8.github.io/branchlab/fair.html), [source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/branchlab), [semantics, proof and inspected sources](https://github.com/midya8/branchlab/blob/main/FAIRNESS.md), [reviewed change](https://github.com/midya8/branchlab/pull/2).

All 29 Python tests and seven Node tests pass, retaining the original ordinary-CTL workflows. Native Tarjan generation, an independent Boolean-closure/recurrent-subset checker and a separately written browser Kosaraju engine agree on 278 full reports, 2,808 region records, 4,135 subformulas and 2,643 fair lassos; 519 changed noninput primitive leaves are rejected. Actual NetworkX 3.4.2 checks all regions, 4,632 components and all lassos as a graph reference, not a full fair-CTL oracle. The existing actual pyModelChecking 1.3.4 ordinary reference still matches 212 requests and 3,630 subformula sets; its fairness route is explicitly excluded after three reproducible disagreements. Real Chrome exercises 36 fair reports at 1280/390/320 pixels, 216 regions, 612 region/start selections, 465 subformula selections, 390 witness rows and 2,628 graph edges, with twelve trusted downloads independently replayed. Fresh installed wheels confirm nine module origins, twelve fair controls through both entrypoints, 24 forged CLI atomic-preservation checks and 24 direct forgeries, retaining ordinary installation checks. All 46 exact public files, feature/PR and main CI, Pages, deployed assets, behavior and 43 unmasked screenshot comparisons were verified.

This is bounded explicit checking for supplied total graphs of at most six states and four state-based justice sets. Every constraint must recur infinitely often on the same path. Local atoms and Boolean operators remain local; temporal operators use fair paths, and universal truth without a fair continuation is displayed as vacuous rather than progress. Fair EG searches inside the operand region before checking recurrence; intersecting ordinary EG with globally fair states is not sound. An empty justice set excludes every path, while no justice constraints recovers ordinary CTL. These are generalized-Buchi execution assumptions, not strong/compassion fairness, an implemented scheduler, new model-checking theory, a scalable symbolic solver or a guarantee about real AI agents. Engines share the written contract and strict input schema; the independent checker also reuses the separately implemented ordinary-CTL replay. Teaching sources use different Boolean conventions, and the chosen convention and contrast are documented rather than blended.


## EpistemLab0.3: the fact stays, who saw it changes

EpistemLab0.3 separates uncertainty about a world from uncertainty about an event. The S5 informational-action inspector keeps every world/event candidate, precondition result, inherited fact, product partition and both component conditions for every possible arrow. In the original read-p/read-not-p/idle control, the receiver learns p but the observer still does not know whether the receiver learned; removing idle changes that nested knowledge without making p common knowledge. A separately labeled public-announcement counterfactual would make all three queries true. Every subformula, modal obligation, path and before/after pair-level change is inspectable. [Live event inspector](https://midya8.github.io/epistemlab/events.html), [source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/epistemlab), [product derivation and inspected sources](https://github.com/midya8/epistemlab/blob/main/EVENTS.md), [reviewed change](https://github.com/midya8/epistemlab/pull/3).

All 30 Python tests and thirteen Node/Chrome tests pass, retaining the original public-announcement and Boolean-disclosure workflows. Complete native, independent relation-row and browser reports agree on 648 requests, 2,552 Cartesian candidates, 5,984 product-arrow obligations and 9,208 before/after subformula sets; 1,072 separately altered noninput primitive leaves are rejected. Actual pyModelChecking 1.3.4 independently reconstructs products and checks 1,944 snapshots and 13,812 sets through 8,961 ordinary CTL calls. Real Chrome exercises 36 control/width reports at 1280/390/320, 129 retained-cell interactions, 255 source rows, 1,743 selected relation obligations, 783 subformula selections, 963 modal obligations, 3,219 path rows and twelve trusted completed downloads replayed natively. Fresh installed wheels verify eleven module origins, twelve event controls through two entrypoints and 24 forged CLI atomic-output checks plus 24 direct forgeries, retaining both prior eight-control families. All 57 exact public files, feature/PR and main CI, Pages, deployed assets/behavior and 39 complete unmasked screenshot comparisons were verified.

Preconditions are evaluated before the event, and can become false afterward. The actual event marks a pointed pair; it does not delete alternative events, and equal preconditions do not merge copies. A nonempty global product can lack the designated pair: post-event focus values are then null, not false or a vacuous dynamic-box verdict. Both supplied world and event relations are equivalence partitions, preserving S5 on every nonempty product. This models observed sensing or uncertainty whether a read happened, not a fully unnoticed secret where an outsider falsely excludes the actual event. Bounds are four worlds, three informational events and twelve retained pairs. No factual assignments, probabilities, belief revision, directed deceptive events, action composition, nested dynamic operators, planning, new theory, symbolic scalability or real human/LLM knowledge guarantee. The generator and checker reuse the existing separately implemented pointwise and truth-set/Floyd modal engines, respectively; shared schema and written semantics are disclosed. The optional CTL translation is implementation evidence, not an independent event parser or theorem proof.


## BuchiLab0.3: the maximum that keeps returning

Even wins both states, yet its first complete policy loses. BuchiLab 0.3 adds a separate max-parity inspector: a priority-1 wait loop loses, repeatedly visiting priority 2 wins, and a finite priority-7 prefix never overrides a recurring priority-0 cycle. A control changes only ownership to expose an odd self-loop hidden inside an even-maximal SCC. The page opens every classic Zielonka recursive subgame, both attractors, each synchronous exists/all predecessor obligation and every original named move.

Every complete policy retains every opponent move. Threshold-induced SCCs expose losing subcycles, with reachability computed in the full retained graph so a high-priority finite prefix cannot hide them. A separate checker uses set recursion, positive-length Floyd classes and every joint-policy root lasso; the browser uses its own set/BFS/path implementation and checks each fixed policy against the full joint atlas. Canonical strategies are the first complete policies winning the entire region, extracted by bounded enumeration, not claimed as direct recursive strategy synthesis.

660 complete native/checker/browser reports cover 576 exhaustive two-state arenas, 72 seeded arenas and 12 original controls; 207 primitive-leaf mutations are rejected. Actual pinned Oink runs three solver families 1,980 times, checks 3,960 regions and verifies all 660 supplied canonical strategies plus good/bad calibrations. Fresh wheels check two entrypoints and nine installed module origins; actual Chrome checks every displayed recursive call, round, policy root and joint lasso at 1280/390/320, with 12 trusted completed downloads and 45 full-state pixel comparisons. This is a six-state, fully visible, total, turn-based max-parity game inspector, not a new scalable solver, learning system or real-agent guarantee. Existing repeated-goal and action-lasso workflows remain separate.

## HallLab0.4: a spare value is not a cycle

One variable and two values produce three singleton alternating SCCs, but both domain edges have support. HallLab's fourth inspector follows a free value through an even alternating path, flips its edges, and shows the resulting full assignment. Compare cycle support, tight Hall pruning, isolated values, empty scope and impossible partial matchings. Every original edge has a directed arc and either an explicit full matching or a forced-residual Hall obstruction. Dummy-node SCCs expose the equivalent characterization without hiding where the spare value starts.

The native generator uses augmenting matching, Tarjan SCCs and free-root reachability; a separate checker uses exhaustive partial tuples and Floyd closure, while the browser independently uses assignment recursion and BFS classes. All 5,058 tiny domain graphs, 120 seeded bound-wide cases, 821 complete cross-language reports and 136 primitive forgeries are checked. Actual pinned Choco4.10.18 AC_REGIN propagation agrees over 821 cases, with real FC/NEQS/AC calibration. Thirty-six Python tests and 12 Node/Chrome tests preserve all previous tests; a fresh installed wheel checks both new entrypoints and atomic failure behavior.

The deployed inspector replays all 12 controls at 1280/390/320, every edge certificate, reach layer, SCC and flip step, with trusted completed JSON downloads and narrow-screen rightmost-scroll checks. Native source, clean public reproduction, feature/PR/main CI, Pages assets, complete screenshots and all four showcase sections were checked. This is classical bounded all-different theory on at most six variables and eight values, not a new algorithm, production incremental solver, learned model, scale benchmark or whole-CSP guarantee. The earlier matching/Hall, overlapping-scope and conflict/removal workflows remain separate.

## BellmanLab0.4: a policy between policies

A budget can make every high-reward deterministic policy infeasible while a randomized stationary policy remains optimal. The live inspector exposes the whole cost/reward polygon, clipped feasible vertices, exact occupancy flow, a state-conditional policy and an independently checked primal-dual certificate. In the wait/exit control, half-and-half mixing of two deterministic policies produces local exit probability 1/3, not 1/2: mixing policies and randomizing actions are different operations. A separate one-state control attains reward 1 under budget 1/2 while the best feasible deterministic policy earns 0. Infeasible budgets return a checked minimum-cost lower bound, not a fabricated policy.

The new dependency-free Python API and CLI use exact fractions; a separate checker reconstructs the complete report with determinant/Cramer solves and gift wrapping rather than the generator's helpers. The browser uses BigInt rationals and a separately implemented engine. All 88 Python tests and four Node tests pass, retaining all 70 earlier tests and three reproducible SVGs. Across 861 exhaustive/seeded/control inputs, complete browser reports equal native output and 1,722 actual SciPy HiGHS LP solves agree within 1e-8; an extra full-bound report checks integers beyond JavaScript's safe range. An independent full-flow vertex oracle covers 28 cases, and 169 non-input primitive-leaf forgeries are rejected. A fresh isolated wheel reproduces the prior three demo families and the new API/CLI outside the source tree. Feature, PR, merged-main and Pages jobs are green.

The deployed five assets and root are byte-exact to merged source. Real Chrome checks 36 reports at 1280, 390 and 320 pixels, every policy/vertex selection in those controls, 12 completed JSON downloads verified by the native checker and 42 unmasked pixel states. This is classical normalized discounted occupancy-measure planning for one supplied expected-cost constraint, limited to four states and eight total actions. It is not a new algorithm, learned model, scale benchmark, per-trajectory safety guarantee or combination with the separate rectangular-robust planner. Shared theory/schema/tie conventions mean agreement is evidence, not a formal proof.

## BisimLab0.4: the loop must stay inside

Two protocol states can both loop forever and still disagree about *where* that loop is possible. The new [explicit-divergence inspector](https://midya8.github.io/bisimlab/divergence.html) compares ordinary branching equivalence with unrooted divergence-preserving branching equivalence. It enumerates every set partition of a supplied finite protocol, retains every state's internal reachability, complete exit signatures, canonical nonempty-cycle lassos and every failed same-block obligation, then checks the coarsest valid partition explicitly. Earlier strong/modal, trace-product and divergence-insensitive workflows remain separate and unchanged.

The opening six-state example reconstructs and credits Luttik2020 Example3/Figure1. Both states are globally divergent, yet only one can diverge while staying in the class where the visible action remains available. A global cycle flag would miss the distinction. This is established theory, not a newly invented counterexample.

Independent checks include a simple-path/block-insertion verifier without generator imports, a direct relational attack/response oracle with matrix cycle closure, 220 individually rejected non-input leaf mutations, and 1,157 complete Python/JavaScript atlases containing 8,720 partitions, 37,743 state records and 19,346 failure records. Actual unmodified pinned mCRL2 agrees on 353 frameworks / 3,672 unordered-pair-semantics comparisons. All 32 Python tests and 12 Node/Chrome tests pass. A fresh isolated wheel retains all prior controls/entrypoints and reproduces 13 new controls through both new entrypoints, checks three new module origins and rejects 26 forged reports.

Actual Chrome checks 39 control-width reports at 1280/390/320, all 843 candidate selections, 4,467 state rows, 2,955 failure rows and 13 trusted completed JSON downloads verified by the native checker. Forty-seven complete unmasked visual states match the reviewed implementation after deployment. Wide exact tables deliberately scroll horizontally inside the page.

Bounds: 1..6 states, 0..3 labels and 18 unique edges, at most 203 partitions. This is exact bounded educational model checking, not a scalable verification engine, learned model, benchmark, formal proof or agent safety/liveness guarantee. A report certifies only the supplied finite model, not its correspondence to a program. Shared theory/schema/canonicalization remain common assumptions.

## ShieldLab0.3: again is a different promise

An acknowledgement can arrive once without ever arriving again. The separate **safe recurrence inspector** checks that a supplied finite game stays safe forever and visits a target infinitely often, against every environment choice. Targets are live, not terminal: their outgoing moves still count. The old safety and first-goal inspectors retain their meanings.

[Inspect safe recurrence](https://midya8.github.io/shieldlab/recurrence.html) | [Source](https://github.com/midya8/shieldlab) | [Exact method and inspected sources](https://github.com/midya8/shieldlab/blob/main/RECURRENCE.md)

- Every nested greatest/least fixed-point round and successor obligation, including unchanged rounds and outer restarts.
- Both players' complete positional-policy atlases, every root outcome, all winning policy IDs and canonical labeled unsafe or nonempty-cycle failure witnesses.
- Complete branching strategy/counterstrategy graphs retain every opponent move and stop only at unsafe, never at a target. One favorable path or target-containing SCC is not a recurrence guarantee.
- Independent native full-report replay by unique strategy-pair simulation, a third matrix-cycle oracle and independent JavaScript. Strict atomic native CLI, isolated installed reproduction and trusted downloadable JSON.

Reproduced from the exact public source: **39 Python tests**, all **74,088 three-state graph/owner/safety-target configurations**, **498 complete native/JavaScript/checker reports** and **163 individually rejected primitive-leaf mutations**. Actual Chrome at 1280/390/320 checks 36 complete control reports, every nested obligation and both policy atlases; all 12 trusted completed downloads are independently accepted by the native checker. Fresh installed checks retain all old safety/first-goal controls and entrypoints. Exact tested counts and assumptions are in the contract.

Established finite safety-and-Buchi theory, with original supplied controls, not a new algorithm or a measured agent result. Bounds: six states, three moves per state and at most 729 positional assignments per player. No fairness, probabilities, partial observation, scalable solver, formal proof or real-agent safety/liveness guarantee. No private data, paid API or hosted inference.


## ShapleyLab 0.3: Together changes the share

The same three-way product can assign `[1/3, 1/3, 1/3]` to individual features, `[1/2, 1/2]` to two atomic groups, and `[1/4, 1/4, 1/2]` to Owen members when `a,b` must arrive together. One score and background, different allowed orders. Equal splitting and post-summing ordinary credits are not the same rule.

The two-level Owen mode keeps every background-replacement evaluation, member coefficient, quotient-group marginal and complete admissible ordering. Its native checker imports no generator and independently replays the declared synthetic score and full allocation report. The independent browser computes permutation-count weights, lets you edit the supplied model and partition, and downloads evidence that the native CLI can verify.

72 Python tests include 556 signed game/partition cases checked across 50,362 independent Fraction orderings, 14,668 unanimity-support/partition cases and separate primitive-mutation checks. 132 complete native/JavaScript reports agree, plus 206 broad-magnitude, half-even, subnormal and cancellation reports independently native-verify. An original BigInt binary64-unit summation helper fixes a pre-release double-rounding failure without widening tolerance. Actual Chrome checks all 12 original controls at 320/390/1280, 12 trusted completed native-verified downloads, and raw/sigmoid six-feature/32-background requests with 2017 evaluations and 720 paths each. Fresh installed-wheel checks preserve all 95 prior edit archives and original modes. All 24 feature/PR checks, 12 main checks and three Pages jobs passed. All ten deployed assets and the original root match public source; all 45 deployed browser states match the tested unmasked pixels.

Established coalitional-value theory, original supplied synthetic controls, no new allocation theorem or measured explanation-quality result. Standalone supplied tables support up to eight features; full declared-score/browser reports up to six features and 32 background rows. Computed float leaves compare at disclosed absolute/relative `1e-12`; integer metadata remain exact. Replay is not authentication or a global error bound. A supplied partition does not validate a background or prevent off-reference within-block hybrids. No arbitrary nested hierarchy, conditional/causal effect, learned grouping, paid API or private data.


## DriftLens 0.2: choosing is part of the test

[Live exact-orbit inspector](https://midya8.github.io/driftlens/) · [Source](https://github.com/midya8/driftlens) · [Method, nine sources and limits](https://github.com/midya8/driftlens/blob/main/ORBIT.md) · [Merged implementation](https://github.com/midya8/driftlens/pull/1)

A dependency-free rational supplied-Gram mode makes kernel-family selection visible: enumerate every allowed label allocation, compute every diagonal-excluding MMD² and tied upper-tail rank, then recalibrate the smallest rank over that same shared orbit. Prespecified blocks preserve their observed reference counts; frozen labels stay frozen. Exact singular PSD certificates, complete global tails, separate Holm comparisons and editable local JSON remain inspectable and downloadable. The independent native checker uses binary masks, direct ordered-pair scores and certificate reconstruction rather than trusting generator output; the separate browser engine uses BigInt rational arithmetic.

In one original six-row, three-view development control at alpha 1/5, the uncorrected smallest raw p rejects 8/20 allowed allocations, the global test 4/20 and Holm-any 0/20. These are complete finite-orbit counts, not measured real-world false-positive rates or a power benchmark. The control was searched and selected in development.

Fresh public main reproduces all 58 Python tests, four Node tests and isolated installed-wheel commands, preserving all 45 prior Python tests and the original floating RBF modes. Checks include 50 rational orbits/1,410 allocations, 729 matrices against independent principal-minor PSD acceptance, and 753 single-leaf evidence mutations. Ninety-five complete native/JavaScript reports match exactly across 3,289 allocations, 12,600 scores and 179,225 global-tail memberships. Actual deployed Chrome covers eleven controls at 320/390/1280, all 372 allocation views and 51 matrix views, eleven trusted completed native-verified downloads, stale-state clearing, malformed requests and the ten-row/six-kernel/252-allocation boundary. All 20 feature/PR checks, ten main checks and three Pages jobs passed; all five deployed assets and the root match public source, and all 42 deployed browser states match tested unmasked pixels.

This implements established finite randomization/minimum-p ideas, not a new test, automatic bandwidth optimizer or MMDAgg. One global decision requires a justified uniform allowed-allocation null and label-independent supplied family. Finite PSD proves geometry, not exchangeability. No strong component-wise, causal, equivalence, power or always-valid monitoring claim; replay is consistency checking, not authentication. Tiny bounded exact orbits only: 4-10 pooled rows, 1-6 supplied kernels. No paid API, private data or model download.


## CTCLab 0.2 - what the beam forgot

[Repository](https://github.com/midya8/ctclab) · [Exact prefix inspector](https://midya8.github.io/ctclab/prefix.html) · [Method and limits](https://github.com/midya8/ctclab/blob/main/PREFIX.md)

Exact supplied rational CTC frame laws make prefix pruning inspectable: every positive blank/nonblank transition, surviving prefix, first-cut loss and final transcript. A separate path-enumeration checker reconstructs the entire evidence report, and an independent browser BigInt engine agrees on 155 complete reports. The original floating-point target atlas remains intact.

Twelve original development controls include a selected five-frame counterexample: width 3 chooses the true MAP transcript with full mass 47403/226100; width 4 chooses a lower-mass transcript, 11691/56525, despite retaining more total path mass. Strict permanent path pruning does not restore discarded contributions. The sufficient bound L > R + D certifies a unique MAP only under the supplied independent-frame law; a false bound makes no failure claim.

Reproduction checks: 34 Python tests, 6 Node tests, 120 seeded path cases, 384 exhaustive binary-law cases, 270 altered report leaves, actual Chrome tables at 320/390/1280 pixels and 12 native-verified downloads. An isolated installed wheel checks both prefix CLI entrypoints across all 12 controls and refuses 24 forged reports. The original mode is reproduced too.

These are synthetic controls selected during development, not held-out speech evaluation. At most 4,096 complete paths. No trained recognizer, new CTC algorithm, calibrated confidence, production-scale, quality or speed claim. Exact arithmetic removes rounding error, not search approximation. No paid API, private data or model download.


## AbsorbLab 0.3: the last exit changes everything

Move probability mass between two destinations of one nonterminal row and inspect an entire exact rational response, not only a sensitivity estimate. The default original control keeps success at one as its last exit becomes arbitrarily unlikely, then drops to zero when that exit disappears. The inspector separates the interior limit from each endpoint's actual support and direct solve. A retry control has success `(1/4+t)/(1/2+t)`, with first derivative one and second derivative minus four at zero. Success-conditioned traffic includes visits, every directed edge count and timing, showing where successful paths go. [Live row-response inspector](https://midya8.github.io/absorblab/response.html), [source and reproduction](https://github.com/midya8/absorblab), [derivation and seven-source ledger](https://github.com/midya8/absorblab/blob/main/RESPONSE.md), [reviewed change](https://github.com/midya8/absorblab/pull/3).

All 42 Python and eleven Node tests retain both previous workflows. Native rank-one generation, independent Cramer/cofactor replay and BigInt recomputation agree on 146 full reports, 1,909 samples, 464 state curves and 61,255 conditional edge cells; 774 separately changed certificate leaves are rejected. Actual Chrome checks 1,293 root/sample views at 1280/390/320 pixels, twelve trusted completed downloads with native replay and twelve extra dense six-state views with long fractions and terminal roots. Fresh installed wheels check fourteen module origins, both response entrypoints and 24 direct plus 24 CLI forgeries with atomic preservation. The invoked SymPy 1.14.0 reference checks 928 symbolic success/failure curves and 10,290 derivative pairs, with support verified separately. Exact public source, feature/PR/main CI, Pages, deployed assets, behavior and desktop/phone layouts were verified.

The open transfer interval has fixed positive support; each endpoint is a separate chain. Zero-success conditioning is undefined, terminal visits/outgoing edges are excluded, and restricted visits do not assert finite lifetime in closed nonterminal classes. The plot joins sampled points; the displayed rational formula defines the full interval. These are supplied one-to-six-state chains and established finite Markov, Doob-transform and rank-one inverse methods, not learned behavior, causal intervention, new probability theory, general parameter synthesis, a scalable solver or a guarantee about real AI agents.


## BellmanLab 0.5: two budgets, one policy

Two separately achievable budgets can still be impossible together. The new exact inspector keeps both expected costs visible and enumerates the full feasible occupancy vertices, not only their two-dimensional projection. One original three-action control needs a mixture of three deterministic policies: weights 5/12, 1/3 and 1/4 attain reward 3/2 under ceilings 1/3 and 1/4, while the best feasible deterministic policy earns zero. A different control has separately attainable ceilings but a checked joint infeasibility gap of 1/6. Visit rates reweight an initial policy mixture into local action probabilities; a feasible reward/cost projection alone is not a full policy witness.

The dependency-free Python generator returns every deterministic policy, every feasible full vertex, all optimal vertices, an exact full-occupancy mixture and a re-solved stationary policy. A separate checker uses Cramer/determinant solves and one-, two- and three-policy simplex intersections rather than generator helpers. Bellman action inequalities, two nonnegative multipliers and complementary slackness certify feasible optima; a weighted minimum-cost bound certifies joint impossibility. Valid alternative multiplier witnesses are accepted. An independent BigInt browser engine agrees on 822 complete reports, including a dense four-state case beyond JavaScript's safe integer range. Actual SciPy 1.15.3 HiGHS checks all 822 problems: 692 feasible and 130 infeasible, with worst reward error below 4.5e-10.

Reproduction retains the original and one-budget workflows: 103 Python tests, eight Node tests, 958 rejected non-input primitive-leaf mutations and isolated installed-wheel checks of both new CLI entrypoints. Actual deployed Chrome checks 36 control reports, 108 policy selections, 117 vertex selections, three extra dense reports and twelve trusted completed downloads replayed by the native checker at 1280/390/320 pixels. All ten deployed assets match merged source; 42 full unmasked captures match the inspected local rendering. Feature, pull-request, merged-main and Pages checks are green.

This is exact classical occupancy-measure planning for a supplied discounted MDP, limited to one-to-four states, eight total actions and exactly two expected-cost ceilings. Budgets are expectations under the supplied initial distribution, not trajectory caps or real-world safety guarantees. It is not learned, scalable, combined with the separate robust planner, or a new algorithm. Shared mathematical assumptions mean cross-checks are evidence rather than formal proof.
